With this course we would like to bridge the gap between on the one hand abstract statistics and (micro-economic) theory and on the other hand putting this in practice when doing (empirical) research. As such the course can as well be seen as preparation for the bachelor thesis. But above all, the course aims to provide students with some tools that we see as very useful for research in the social sciences (and outside the social sciences as well). As we only have a limited amount of time available for this course, the amount of topics we can deal with is by its nature restricted. We decided to focus in the first three week on economic welfare from a behavioral perspective. Not only is the concept of economic welfare central to all most all economic theories, the behavioral perspective allows for more reflection on the assumptions typically made. The last three parts of the course move on to empirical analysis by focusing on the basics of applied econometrics and as such builds upon the foundations of the statistics course in the first period. But now we challenge the student to build more elaborate statistical models (based partly upon the theory of the first three week of this course) where specific attention is given to presentation and interpretation "],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction 2.1 Why this book? 2.2 Theory, Models and Hypotheses 2.3 Doing research 2.4 Reading guide", " 2 Introduction 2.1 Why this book? 2.2 Theory, Models and Hypotheses 2.3 Doing research 2.3.1 Statistical software The statistical software we use in this course is STATA. 2.4 Reading guide "],["introduction-to-economic-surplus.html", "3 Introduction to Economic Surplus 3.1 Introduction", " 3 Introduction to Economic Surplus Practical cost-benefit analysis is widely used in applied economic analysis and often employs a definition of economic surplus that adds up consumer and producer surplus and potential external costs. These lecture notes discuss the behavioural assumptions underlying this calculation and show how to operationalise the definition of economic surplus to derive economic surplus changes and externality taxes. It employs a mathematical approach suitable applied economic partial equilibrium analysis. 3.1 Introduction 3.1.1 Background These lecture notes introduce the classical economic perspective on economic surplus. Economic surplus is a quantitative estimate of the value that markets generate for society according to economists. Besides analysing the impacts of economic policies for societies (do policies have effects and do they work as intended?), one of the core tasks of economists is to give recommendations about what is supposed to be valuable for society (do policies add value?). Economic analyses of the value that markets generate also are important in debates about sustainability. What economists contribute to this debate is that they seek to analyse behavioural choices of consumers and producers using statistical techniques and mathematical modelling and that they come up with quantitative estimates of value. The contribution of these lecture notes is that we move from conceptual analysis of market figures to mathematical descriptions and connections to statistical measurement. We do so for partial equilibrium analysis, meaning that we focus on the analysis of a market for a single good. Four conceptual pillars of economic analysis are important for applied economic analysis of surplus and the lecture notes of this week try to emphasize the structural relation between these pillars along the road: Optimization: market actors choose their best (feasible) option. Equilibrium: market actors choose their best feasible option when interacting with others. Empiricism: behavioural models need to be tested with data. Choice-based normativity: choices express value of market actors and value of market actors is equal to value for society.
