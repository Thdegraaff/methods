[["index.html", "Methods and Techniques for Social and Economic Research: Syllabus Preface What Why For Whom", " Methods and Techniques for Social and Economic Research: Syllabus Paul Koster &amp; Thomas de Graaff 2022-09-22 Preface What This syllabus provides the course material for the course Methods and Techiques for Social and Economic Research. With this course we would like to bridge the gap between on the one hand abstract statistics and (micro-economic) theory and on the other hand putting all this in practice when doing (empirical) research. As such the course can as well be seen as preparation for the bachelor thesis. But above all, the course aims to provide students with some tools that we see as very useful for research; not only in the social sciences but outside the social sciences as well. As we only have a limited amount of time available for this course, the amount of topics we can deal with is by its nature restricted. We decided to focus in the first three week on economic welfare from a behavioral perspective. Not only is the concept of economic welfare central to all most all economic theories, the behavioral perspective allows for more reflection on the neo-classical assumptions typically made in introductionary economic courses. The last three parts of the course move on to empirical analysis by focusing on the basics of applied econometrics and as such builds upon the foundations of the statistics course in the first period. But now we challenge the student to build more elaborate statistical models (based partly upon the theory of the first three week of this course) where specific attention is given to presentation and interpretation of the results. Why Although there are many and very good introductory textbooks on economic models and applied econometrics, the combination of the two is seldomly seen. Apart from that there are two reasons why we wanted to write our own material. First, usually less time is spent on why certain, and a first sight very restrictive, assumptions are made. We want to bridge that gap and provide the student with more intuition on where models, evidence, and finally perhaps the ``truth’’ (if there is such a thing) comes from. Second, how to present statistical evidence and the interpretation of that evidence is very important but usually not given much attention. For Whom This syllabus assumes that the reader has a basic working knowledge of introductory economics, statistics and some calculus (typically those method courses students enjoy in their first year). The book can however be read as stand-alone, although that requires some more attentive reading. Where we think it is necessary we provide (references to) background material. For the course Methods and Techiques for Social and Economic Research the syllabus should be read in total and it might be wise to read the relevant material before the respective lecture. THe big advantage of course is that lectures and reading material now really go one-on-one. "],["introduction.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 Theory, Models and Hypotheses 1.2 Doing Research (in the Social Sciences) 1.3 Reading Guide", " 1 Introduction In this first introductory chapter, we will lay out the relations between theory development and theory testing as they are the cornerstones of scientific progress. After all, a theory or idea can only be scientific if the theory can be tested and if need be refuted. If the theory cannot be tested then it is not science. We will also explain the basic workflow of scientific research and the tools needed with specific emphasis on research in the social sciences. We end with a reading guide where we discuss each chapter and the relations between the chapters. 1.1 Theory, Models and Hypotheses In 2021, Guido Imbens, Joshua Angrist and David Card received the Nobel price for economics (officially The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel). The field they work in is applied econometrics with specific focus on finding causal relations. That means that with data they want to test whether phenomenon \\(X\\) has an effect on phenomenon \\(Y\\). And that is what most applied econometric work nowadays is focused on. And we will focus on that as well in Chapter 5, 6 and 7. But how do you know what to test, or, in other words, where do \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) come from? Those phenomena and possible relations originate from scientific theories as you will have in all disciplines. And those theories are typically casts in models—usually in a very abstract manner. Models come in the form of computer simulations (such as with agent-based modeling), real physical models (as with displays), but often models are formulated in mathematical notation with the aim of being as precise, lucid and clear as possible. Chapter 2, 3 and 4 will indeed deal with a specific subset of economic models formulated with mathematical notation. But note that those models are not necessarily theory. Theory is the underlying set of relations and assumptions that can say something the specific structure of models, but very often theory can lead to multiple types of models, each perhaps highlighting different aspects of the underlying theory. An example of such a theory is the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility: each additional unit of the same good is appreciated less by consumers. This theory can be expressed in many mathematical ways but the underlying concept as displayed in Figure 1.1 always remains the same. This type of function, increasing but slower and slower, belongs to the family of concave functions. A function with exponential growth (such as \\(e^{gt}\\) belongs to the family of convex functions). Figure 1.1: Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility So how to related this with each other in scientific research? Well, when doing research you are interested in something that is not yet known (the research gap). Your aim is to (partly) fill this research gap by answering a research question. To answer this research question you need theory (a theoretical framework); what do you need to assume, what are the most important (moderator) variables, how do they relate with each other, and so on and so forth. From this theory you construct a model. Not necessarily a mathematical one. For example, you can also make a model in a Geographical Information System environment where you visualize layers of information that you think are most relevant based upon theory (in this case often previous scientific literature). Or you make a simulation model examining risks of flooding by rivers. The final step is the stage where your model should provide you with some answers. Sometimes they are concerned with optimality (what is the best location of a new road in a GIS environment), prediction (where are river dikes most vulnerable), or with establishing a (causal) relation. And it is the latter that the second part of this course deals with. How can we know that there is a relation between phenomenon \\(X\\) and phenomenon \\(Y\\) and how do we know whether that relation is causal? For that we use applied econometrics (which is a form of applied statistics but then in the social sciences domain–the exact difference will be discussed in Chapter 5). And to establish a, hopefully causal, relation, we test our models with empirical data. The applied econometrics we teach in this course (and in all introductory courses of applied statistics and econometrics all over the world—the “101” courses) is based on so-called frequentist statistics (we will revisit its basic assumptions in Chapter 5). The exact definition is not important for now but know that it is intrinsically related with hypothesis testing. And hypothesis testing is most often associated with that scientific philosopher—and perhaps the only one you know—Karl Popper (as displayed in 1.2). Figure 1.2: Karl Popper Popper was a so-called empiricist and claimed that theories in the empirical sciences (that includes most of the social sciences) can never be proven, only rejected. That is why you can reject a null-hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)), but never accept the alternative hypothesis (\\(H_a\\)). And this is very much related with the theoretical framework behind frequentist statistics. Loosely speaking, in frequentist statistics you construct a world where \\(H_0\\) is true and try to reject that world with data (we will come back to this in Chapter 5)—but that world does not say something the validity of the alternative hypothesis. Now, Popper never claimed that rejecting one null-hypothesis will reject a whole theory. For that you need a larger body of evidence, including results from all sorts of studies—not only statistical ones, leading to a general consensus among the scientific community (Popper 2005). In truth, although the scientific approach of working with null-hypotheses is a very valuable one (and remarkably practical), it does not lead to definitive answers. That is because contradicting models can lead to similar null-hypotheses. Moreover, often the direct connection between research question and null-hypothesis is not a direct one. Consider that you want to know the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\), so your research question is: “What is the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\)?”. But, in a frequentist world you only reject hypotheses—thus leading to results in the line of: “The effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) is not \\(\\ldots\\)”. This makes the evidence for your research question at least circumstantial and in the best cases indirect. The bottom-line here is that one needs to be careful in drawing conclusions based on null-hypotheses (and in a broader sense based on models in general). Scientific research typically advances very slowly—but hopefully in a robust and parsimonious way! 1.2 Doing Research (in the Social Sciences) It is remarkable that, although in principle students are prepared for scientific research, they receive little guidance in how they should do scientific research. What are the tips &amp; tricks of the trade and what—and, more importantly why—should you use specific (types of) applications and what is the relation between them. In our view most of this should belong in your first course upon entering the university (with course title “Methods 101”). And some of it you indeed have learned in your first year, but in our experience students still lack “operational” knowledge. Therefore, we discuss below the four elements we think are among the most important. There are others, but for now this will do. 1.2.1 Work tidy and know where your stuff is Our first and most important tip is to work tidy. Try to make your work look good. And with work we mean everything you submit (such as tutorials, papers, examinations, and theses). And that is because lecturers are just like people and often think from primary instincts with their reptilian brain: if it doesn’t look good, not much time is spent on arguing and thinking as well! Moreover, when your work is difficult to read, lecturers get annoyed. Making your work look good and in the same time more lucid and transparent also serves a higher purpose as it is then easier to detect mistakes. Namely, everyone makes mistakes. The important thing is to detect them early, learn from them and remedy them. This advances science in general and is a very important feature of the scientific process. Chapter 7 will spent additional time on working tidy and making it looking good. A second very straightforward tip is to be organised and to know where your stuff is. Often, students come to us for help with all their files piled on a stack on their desktop and facing difficulties finding where their work is. It is always advisable to use a folder structure and have one folder for one project (course). And to the use sub-folders for data, text, code, pdf’s and so forth. A second tip for organisation is to think about versioning. As the well-known Figure 1.3 shows the number of versions of one file very quickly can get out of hand. Think at least about a consistent naming structure (perhaps with the date involved such as paper_mt_20221215.doc). Figure 1.3: Version confusion 1.2.2 Make notes One skill that in our opinion is given not too much attention is making useful notes. It has been proven that writing things down is beneficial; not only for remembering but also for understanding. And that seems to be best just by using a pen as this slows writing down and you have to think what to write down. Underlining or marking is useful less beneficial than writing accompanying notes. But when should you write notes? Well, when attending lectures of course but also when reading. To leverage your notes as much as possible it is important that you have a system where you can retrieve your notes and compare them with other notes. The latter is the hardest part, but is in the long run the most rewarding as new connections are created between lectures, courses, books, and years. You do not need any fancy tools for this (there is literally a ton of applications to be found on internet), Microsoft’s Onenote or Evernote are more than good enough . Where the workflow typically is to first use pen and paper to capture notes and thereafter rewrite and organise your notes in a notes system. 1.2.3 Use a reference manager Perhaps the tool that has the quickest pay-off is a reference manager. For those of you who are not using one yet: do it. Why? Because you never have to think about your reference list again. All reference managers come with plugins for Word or other text-editors (or type-setters such as \\(\\LaTeX\\) that enable you to automatically generate reference list based upon in-text citations which the reference manager can also provide. You only need less than an hour to set it up, but you very quickly become more efficient (and thus save time in future work). There are many reference managers out there, but we advise Zotero as it is open source. There is both a cloud and desktop version and it comes with a handy tutorial. It also provides a plugin for your browser to automatically import the bibliographic details of the paper you are reading at the moment. 1.2.4 Statistical software As quantitative research become more and more important in the social sciences you need software to manage your data and provides statistical and applied econometric analyses. Ideally, an open-source package is used (such as R or Python), but they have a steep-learning curve and do not work immediately out-of-the-box. The statistical software we use in this course is STATA and is more intuitive (compared to R or Python that is!) and, above all, all economists use it. So, the user base is large and that is important, because for each problem there is much material to be found on internet (including video’s). There is a disadvantage from using STATA and that is that it is not open-source. 1.3 Reading Guide This course will not concern itself with theory as such, but more with methods to describe that theory (the models) and how to test that theory (the applied econometrics). Chapter 2–4 deals with models. "],["surplus.html", "2 Introduction to Economic Surplus 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Consumer choices and consumer value", " 2 Introduction to Economic Surplus Practical cost-benefit analysis is widely used in applied economic analysis and often employs a definition of economic surplus that adds up consumer and producer surplus and potential external costs. These lecture notes discuss the behavioural assumptions underlying this calculation and show how to operationalise the definition of economic surplus to derive economic surplus changes and externality taxes. It employs a mathematical approach suitable applied economic partial equilibrium analysis. 2.1 Introduction These lecture notes introduce the classical economic perspective on economic surplus. Economic surplus is a quantitative estimate of the value that markets generate for society according to economists. Besides analysing the impacts of economic policies for societies (do policies have effects and do they work as intended?), one of the core tasks of economists is to give recommendations about what is supposed to be valuable for society (do policies add value?). Economic analyses of the value that markets generate also are important in debates about sustainability. What economists contribute to this debate is that they seek to analyse behavioural choices of consumers and producers using statistical techniques and mathematical modelling and that they come up with quantitative estimates of value. The contribution of these lecture notes is that we move from conceptual analysis of market figures to mathematical descriptions and connections to statistical measurement. We do so for partial equilibrium analysis, meaning that we focus on the analysis of a market for a single good. Four conceptual pillars of economic analysis are important for applied economic analysis of surplus and the lecture notes of this week try to emphasize the structural relation between these pillars along the road: Optimization: market actors choose their best (feasible) option. Equilibrium: market actors choose their best feasible option when interacting with others. Empiricism: behavioural models need to be tested with data. Choice-based normativity: choices express value of market actors and value of market actors is equal to value for society. The first core principle states that consumers and producers optimize when they make their choices. For consumers this implies it is assumed that they maximize their utility. A mathematical description of utility is captured by the direct utility function which maps consumption quantities and remaining money to some cardinal number. We will discuss the mathematical behavioural model underlying consumer optimization in Section II and discuss the implications for consumer value in markets. We also show at some points how this model of consumer behaviour relates to pillar (iii). For producers, pillar (i) implies that they minimize their costs given a production target when they are assumed to be price-takers. Section III discusses the basic cost-minimization model of producers and the implications for producer value in markets. The second core principle states that equilibrium in markets results from the behavioural choices and interaction of consumers and producers. Section IV of these lecture notes discuss partial equilibrium and implications for total economic value in markets. The discussion in these sections of the lecture notes is conceptually speaking rather basic as substitution to other markets is ignored. Some complexity is added by connecting equilibrium to the third pillar of empiricism. It is very important for you to understand the core concepts and assumptions and the calibration underlying a basic partial equilibrium model in order to understand the extensions that are provided in the weeks that follow. The third pillar is discussed along the way. Empirical analysis can be used to estimate the structural parameters of observed demand functions and production functions using regression techniques. These techniques relate mathematical narratives of choice behaviour to empirical data. The mathematical structure that is imposed sometimes requires that parameters in regression have particular values. Hypothesis testing can be used to see which model fits the data better. Calibration can be used to connect estimated elasticities from the literature to market demand and supply functions. Examples are provided to show how you can obtain quantitative estimates of total economic value. Section V applies the model of market value and introduces the idea of external costs. This is a key concept in environmental economics and analyses of sustainability. From an economic perspective, external costs resulting from market trade lower the value of a market and can be a motivating factor for regulatory intervention of a government. For a classical economist a sustainable market is a market where external costs are correctly priced. Section V discusses the regulation of an environmental externality in a market and thereby provides the necessary bridge between the economic theory and your bachelor program. Analytical examples are provided to show how you can obtain quantitative estimates of total economic value. We will come back to the four pillars in the weeks that follow where we zoom in on the impact of bounded rationality and other views on normativity. 2.2 Consumer choices and consumer value 2.2.1 Utility functions, inverse demand and demand Why do consumers choose to consume particular meat products? What is the consumer value of newly developed vegan product? How does households’ demand for solar panels respond to price decreases? To study these research questions, it is helpful to develop a model of consumer choice. For economists, models of choice are mathematical narratives about how consumers make their choices. The story of consumer choice by economists assumes that consumers optimize the choice value that they derive from the consumption of market goods given constraints they face. In this section the consumer story is partly simplified and we investigate the decision of the consumer to spend money on the market good versus spending money on other goods or services given a budget constraint. We therefore do not study market goods that are close complements or close substitutes. Value is mathematically conceptualized using a direct utility function that depends on the consumption levels. The direct utility function of the consumer is defined by \\(U(Q,G)\\), where \\(Q\\) is the demand for the market good and \\(G\\) is the demand for the outside good. The price of the market good is given by \\(p\\) and the price of the outside good is given by \\(p_G\\). Both prices are given for the consumer and cannot be directly affected by their behaviour. This assumption rules out forms of bilateral bargaining about the market price between consumers and producers. The price for the outside good can be interpreted as the costs or price index for a basket of goods for the consumers, where the market good is excluded from this basket. When prices of products in the basket increase over time, this will impact the price of the outside good. Net spendable income of the consumer is assumed to be exogenous and given by \\(Y\\). This income is after tax income and can be used freely by the consumer. Total spending of the consumer is given by \\(pQ+p_G G\\), because it is assumed that all net income is spent either on the market good or the outside good. The budget constraint of the individual is then given by: \\[\\begin{equation} Y - pQ - p_G G = 0. \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] From this budget constraint we can derive the consumed quantity of the outside good \\(G\\): \\[\\begin{equation} G = \\frac{Y-pQ}{p_G} \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] The quantity consumed of the outside good increases in the income level \\(Y\\), decreases in the price of the basket of goods \\(p_G\\), and decreases in consumer spending \\(pQ\\) on the market good. Substituting this quantity in the direct utility gives us an expression that only has the quantity level of the market good as a choice variable: \\[\\begin{equation} U \\left(Q, \\frac{Y-pQ}{p_G} \\right) \\end{equation}\\] The optimal choice of the quantity of the market good is governed by the utility of consumption (first argument) and the disutility of spending money on the market good (second argument). Optimal consumption can be derived by setting the total derivative with respect to the market quantity to 0: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dU}{dQ} = U_Q - \\frac{P}{P_G}U_G = 0 \\end{equation}\\] Here, \\(U_Q=\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Q}\\) is the marginal utility of consuming the market good. Here we use the notation \\(\\frac{dU}{dQ}\\) for the total derivative (both arguments of the utility function), and the notation \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Q}\\) for the partial derivative with respect to \\(Q\\) (only the first argument). Marginal utility of consumption is the slope of the direct utility function with respect to the first argument \\(Q\\). Furthermore, \\(U_G=\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial G}\\) is the marginal utility of consumption of the outside good. This is equal to the price of the outside good multiplied with the marginal utility of income \\(p_G \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Y}\\). The second part of the first-order condition therefore captures the disutility of paying a price \\(p\\) for the market good. It also accounts for the relative price of the market good compared to the price for the basket of goods. From the first-order condition an implicit expression for the inverse demand curve can be derived. This expression shows that the ratio of prices is equal to the ration of marginal utilities. \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{p}{p_G} = \\frac{U_Q}{U_G} \\longleftrightarrow p = p_G\\frac{U_Q}{U_G} \\end{equation}\\] An implicit solution means that the price \\(p\\) potentially appears at the right-hand side of the equation. This inverse demand curve is the maximum marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for the good. It depends on the relative size of the marginal utilities and increases in the price of the basket of goods. For many practical purposes the price of the basket of goods is normalized to \\(p_G=1\\) resulting in inverse demand as a function of the ratio of marginal utilities: \\[\\begin{equation} p = \\frac{U_Q}{U_G} \\end{equation}\\] The MWTP can be employed as a measure of consumer benefits. Much of the analytical work of demand analysists focusses on particular specifications that result in explicit solutions for the inverse demand curve. These explicit solutions have only exogenous parameters and quantity \\(Q\\) at the right-hand side and can be analysed using empirical data. 2.2.2 Examples of demand and inverse demand functions To illustrate the model, we provide an example of three particular utility functions. First, we discuss a direct utility function without income effects and exponential marginal utility of consumption. Second, we discuss the well-known Cobb-Douglas utility function. This utility function captures non-linear impacts of net spendable income on direct utility. Third, we discuss a specification of the direct utility function that captures minimum threshold levels for consumption. Such a specification is particularly relevant for particular basic goods that a consumer cannot do without. 2.2.2.1 The exponential-linear utility function Suppose direct utility is specified as: \\[\\begin{equation} U(Q,G) = \\frac{A}{\\alpha}\\left( 1- e^{-\\alpha Q} \\right ) + BG \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] The marginal utility of consumption is given by the partial derivative with respect to the market good: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Q} = Ae^{-\\alpha Q} &gt; 0. \\end{equation}\\] This marginal utility is positive implying that direct utility increases when consumption of the market good increases. The marginal utility of the outside good is given by the partial derivative with respect to \\(G\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial G} = B &gt; 0. \\end{equation}\\] It is also positive implying more of the outside good is considered to be better. The direct utility is concave1 in the consumption of the market good and linear in the consumption of the outside good. This can be proved by investigating the second-order partial derivatives which are negative for consumption (first argument) and 0 for the outside good (second argument): \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial Q^2} = - \\alpha Ae^{-\\alpha Q} &lt; 0, \\qquad \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial G^2} = 0. \\end{equation}\\] The intuitive appeal of the assumption of concavity is that the additional utility gained from consuming an additional unit of the market good is decreasing in the consumption level. This implies that the marginal utility of consuming the market good is positive, but decreasing. For example, people might enjoy eating meat, but the additional enjoyment of meat consumption decreases in the consumption level. At some point meat saturation kicks in and marginal utility becomes (close to) 0. In line with pillar (1), the consumer is assumed to maximize utility while accounting for the budget constraint. From the budget constraint we can obtain the consumption level of the outside good: \\[\\begin{equation} Y - pQ - G = 0 \\longleftrightarrow G= Y - pQ. \\end{equation}\\] Remember, concave function have decreasing marginal returns such as in Figure 1.1↩︎ "],["behavioural-error-and-economic-surplus.html", "3 Behavioural Error and Economic Surplus 3.1 Introduction", " 3 Behavioural Error and Economic Surplus 3.1 Introduction These lecture notes investigate the implications of behavioural errors for the calculation of economic surplus. The sub-field of behavioural economics started around 1950 with the pioneering works of Herbert Simon and Ward Edwards. The aim was to develop a novel perspective on rationality and choice behaviour. Laibson and List (2015) define behavioural economics as follows: Behavioural economics uses variants of traditional economic assumptions (often with a psychological motivation) to explain and predict behaviour, and to provide policy prescriptions (p.385). From their perspective, modern behavioural economics therefore can be viewed as an extension of the neo-classical perspective. Laibson and List (2015) suggest that behavioural economics refines three of the key core principles of classical economics (p.386). We add to this list how the fourth pillar ‘normativity’ changes when behavioural errors are present. Optimization: market actors try to choose their best (feasible) option. They employ heuristics or a decision goal function for choosing amounts (utility, costs etc.). Equilibrium: market actors try to choose their best feasible option when interacting with others. This results in a behavioural equilibrium. Empiricism: behavioural models need to be tested with data. Experienced based normativity: experiences (not choices) of market actors generate value and experienced value of market actors is equal to value for society. Compared to the neo-classical paradigm, behavioural economics changes the first core pillar ‘optimization’ by adding the word ‘try’. In classical economic models it is usually assumed that market actors behave rationally: choices of market actors are the result of a rational optimization procedure in the sense that choices track utility value. Behavioural economics has operationalized this idea by replacing the direct utility function by other heuristics or by other kinds of direct utility functions. An example of a consumer heuristic is: buy \\(Q\\) of the market good when it rains and \\(Q+2\\) of the market good when it does not rain. Such a heuristic is independent of the valuation or utility considerations and is therefore difficult to connect to analysis of economic surplus without further assumptions. Examples of different conceptualization of utility functions are utility functions that account for biased processing of probabilities and loss aversion (Tversky and Kahneman 1992). The second pillar states that equilibrium in markets might be affected by behavioural errors as market actors interact with each other and is a logical result of adding behavioural error at the first pillar. According to behavioural economists, consumers and producers seek to optimize, but make behavioural errors. This in turn has impacts on how market actors interact with each other. When consumers and producers make systematic mistakes, this can impact equilibrium prices and quantities, but more in-depth analysis is needed to show what the impacts of behavourial errors is on equilibrium outcomes. The third pillar states that particular assumptions on the rationality of choices made by neo-classical economists should be backed up by empirical analysis. It has been argued by neo-classical economists that choices are made as if market actors are rational. Milton Friedman (1953) wrote about this in his famous essay ‘The methodology of Positive Economics’: Consider the problem of predicting the shots made by an expert billiard player. It seems not at all unreasonable that excellent predictions would be yielded by the hypothesis that the billiard player made his shots as if he knew the complicated mathematical formulas that would give the optimum directions of travel, could estimate accurately by eye the angles, etc., describing the location of the balls, could make lightning calculations from the formulas, and could then make the balls travel in the direction indicated by the formulas. Our confidence in this hypothesis is not based on the belief that billiard players, even expert ones, can or do go through the process described; it derives rather from the belief that, unless in some way or other they were capable of reaching essentially the same result, they would not in fact be expert billiard players. It is only a short step from these examples to the economic hypothesis that under a wide range of circumstances individual firms behave as if they were seeking rationally to maximize their expected returns (generally if misleadingly called “profits”) and had full knowledge of the data needed to succeed in this attempt; as if, that is, they knew the relevant cost and demand functions, calculated marginal cost and marginal revenue from all actions open to them, and pushed each line of action to the point at which the relevant marginal cost and marginal revenues were equal (Friedman, 1953). "],["moral.html", "4 Moral Considerations and Economic Surplus 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Dealing with moral considerations at the valuation stage", " 4 Moral Considerations and Economic Surplus 4.1 Introduction These lecture notes introduce another definition of economic surplus (‘the economic pie’) that allows for moral considerations. It specifically investigates moral considerations related to the normative validity of counting costs and benefits of consumers and producers and external costs as economic social surplus. Why is this important? In the first week we have seen that the classical perspective of economic value rests on four pillars: (i) optimisation, (ii) equilibrium, (iii) empiricism and (iv) choice-based normativity. The implication of this perspective is that choices of market actors perfectly track value for society. The second week provided an extended perspective using insights from psychology. According to this perspective there can be a difference between choice-based value and experienced based value. Given particular assumptions it can be justified that experienced value is the right metric to measure instead of choice-based value. As we have seen, this has implications for policy interventions related to information provision and externality taxation. The lecture notes of week 3 question the results of the first week from a different angle: there can be moral considerations related to the choices of market actors that lead to the question whether it is justified to include the value of consumers, producers and the external costs completely in the economic surplus calculation. Before moving on, it is useful to illustrate why moral considerations are important. Consider a pork producer who is active in the market for pork. The government has set specific rules for pork production for those who want to become active in this market. With the aim of lowering marginal costs, the pork producer ignores some of these rules related to animal welfare without providing good reasons and without changing external costs. The producer rationally trades off lower marginal costs with the probability of getting a fine when being caught. According to the economic model of value developed in week 1 this leads to an increase in producer surplus in the market of pork and thereby into an increase is economic surplus. The example suggests that there are normative limits for behaviour by consumers and producers in markets that might not be captured in behavioural choice. Or consider a philosopher of animal welfare who considers the eating of pork to be morally problematic because pigs are sentient beings ‘like us’. If the reasoning of this philosopher is correct, counting consumer benefits fully as social surplus is likely to be questionable. These two examples at least illustrate that the choice-based normativity perspective (week 1) and experienced-based normativity (week 2) might not be shared by all persons and groups in society. In these lecture notes we therefore change the 4th pillar ‘normativity’ from choice-based to morally-based evaluation. How to deal with this in cost-benefit analysis? The key question to investigate here is: “What should count as ‘better or worse off’?” (Atkinson 2009; Sandel 2013). This normative question can be investigated from different viewpoints: the individual level, the community level and the societal level. At the individual level, consumers and producers make moral commitments to their own perspective on the good life. They might want to eat less meat, fly less and might want to lower their carbon emissions by making more sustainable choices. However, these moral commitments and targets are not always reached leading to a discrepancy between the individuals’ perspective on the good life and their actual choices. Most persons are aware of this gap between their goals and actual behaviour in their personal lives. For example, sometimes individuals make promises to particular sustainability targets to others but do not keep these promises. Another example is the observation of flight shame which suggests that individuals have an independent reflective moral attitude (conscience) towards their own behaviour. Even when choices (week 1) and experiences (week 2) are valuable and decisions are made to buy the product, this suggests that these choices might not be evaluated as truly ‘good’ by the individual. At the community level, individuals participate in communities who determine (partly or fully) what counts as valuable. Community membership can be voluntary or non-voluntary and membership of communities results in particular duties and customs. Communities entail particular minimum standards of behaviour for consumers and producers based on the community values. These standards can be viewed as partly independent of the preferences that are expressed by consumers and producers in their day-to-day market choices. For example, an activist participating in a ‘climate change community’ is likely to be held accountable for behavioural choices: only ‘telling the truth’ is likely not sufficient according the community standards. At the societal level, individuals participate in the common project of living together. Governments can formulate particular minimal sustainability standards for market participants which in turn can lead to particular duties and customs for market actors. This was illustrated with the example of the pork producer above. Furthermore, governments can ask market participants to make concrete commitments in terms of sustainability. Goals can act as targets for moral excellence and result in obligations. In order to count something as valuable for society these different viewpoints can play a role and can result in a discrepancy between choice-based value and morally weighted social value. In line with the results of week 2 this can imply that the social optimum is not reached even when there are no external costs. Note that the different viewpoints do not restrict choice of market actors but seek to foster a plural perspective on what should count as valuable. The remainder of these lecture notes is structured as follows. First, Section II gives an overview of several strategies that are employed to deal with moral considerations when valuing market outcomes. This section motivates why an adjustment of economic surplus is needed when moral considerations are present. Section III develops a novel analytical specification of economic surplus and sections IV and V discuss the implications for pricing. Examples are provided along the way. Section VI concludes. 4.2 Dealing with moral considerations at the valuation stage 4.2.1 Introduction This section discusses four general approaches to deal with moral considerations when analysing (changes) in economic social surplus. The first approach is the ethical checkbox approach (section II.B), the second approach is the economizing ethics approach (section II.C), the third approach is the ethicizing economics approach (section II.D). The fourth approach is the qualitative valuation approach (section II.E). These approaches are not necessarily perfect substitutes but can be employed in a complementary way. 4.2.2 Ethical checkbox approach The first approach to deal with moral considerations is the ‘ethical checkbox’ approach (ECH). This approach analyses moral considerations independently of economic surplus assessments using a list of necessary ethical requirements or rules for the behaviour of market actors. It is closely related to the ‘independent doctrine’ which views (micro-)economics as separate from ethics (see High (1985, p,.4-6), for a "],["regression-analysis-in-the-social-sciences.html", "5 Regression analysis in the social sciences 5.1 Statistical framework 5.2 Univariate regression 5.3 Least squares assumptions 5.4 Testing of coefficients", " 5 Regression analysis in the social sciences Why should we have something as applied econometrics in the social sciences? That is because we have theories as in Chapters (2)–(4) and those theories contain variables such as in the direct utility function of equation (2.3): \\[\\begin{equation} U(Q,G) = \\frac{A}{\\alpha}\\left( 1- e^{-\\alpha Q} \\right ) + BG. \\end{equation}\\] Here the quantities for the market good \\(Q\\) and the outside good \\(G\\) are to considered to be known—also often referred to as data. In theoretical work they are fictional or sometimes simulated. A certain amount of consumption of the market good and the outside good lead then some level of utility which an economist want to maximise. 5.1 Statistical framework 5.2 Univariate regression 5.3 Least squares assumptions 5.4 Testing of coefficients "],["modeling-in-the-social-sciences.html", "6 Modeling in the Social Sciences 6.1 Why more independent variables? 6.2 Multivariate regression analysis 6.3 Using dummy variables 6.4 Non-linear specifications 6.5 Using fixed effects in panel data", " 6 Modeling in the Social Sciences 6.1 Why more independent variables? 6.2 Multivariate regression analysis 6.3 Using dummy variables 6.4 Non-linear specifications 6.4.1 Polynomials 6.4.2 Interaction variables 6.4.3 Logarithms 6.5 Using fixed effects in panel data "],["specification-assessment-issues.html", "7 Specification &amp; Assessment Issues", " 7 Specification &amp; Assessment Issues "],["in-conclusion.html", "8 In conclusion", " 8 In conclusion "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
