[["index.html", "Methods and Techniques for Social and Economic Research: Syllabus Preface What Why For Whom", " Methods and Techniques for Social and Economic Research: Syllabus Paul Koster &amp; Thomas de Graaff 2022-09-26 Preface What This syllabus provides the course material for the course Methods and Techiques for Social and Economic Research. With this course we would like to bridge the gap between on the one hand abstract statistics and (micro-economic) theory and on the other hand putting all this in practice when doing (empirical) research. As such the course can as well be seen as preparation for the bachelor thesis. But above all, the course aims to provide students with some tools that we see as very useful for research; not only in the social sciences but outside the social sciences as well. As we only have a limited amount of time available for this course, the amount of topics we can deal with is by its nature restricted. We decided to focus in the first three week on economic welfare from a behavioral perspective. Not only is the concept of economic welfare central to all most all economic theories, the behavioral perspective allows for more reflection on the neo-classical assumptions typically made in introductionary economic courses. The last three parts of the course move on to empirical analysis by focusing on the basics of applied econometrics and as such builds upon the foundations of the statistics course in the first period. But now we challenge the student to build more elaborate statistical models (based partly upon the theory of the first three week of this course) where specific attention is given to presentation and interpretation of the results. Why Although there are many and very good introductory textbooks on economic models and applied econometrics, the combination of the two is seldomly seen. Apart from that there are two reasons why we wanted to write our own material. First, usually less time is spent on why certain, and a first sight very restrictive, assumptions are made. We want to bridge that gap and provide the student with more intuition on where models, evidence, and finally perhaps the ``truth’’ (if there is such a thing) comes from. Second, how to present statistical evidence and the interpretation of that evidence is very important but usually not given much attention. For Whom This syllabus assumes that the reader has a basic working knowledge of introductory economics, statistics and some calculus (typically those method courses students enjoy in their first year). The book can however be read as stand-alone, although that requires some more attentive reading. Where we think it is necessary we provide (references to) background material. For the course Methods and Techiques for Social and Economic Research the syllabus should be read in total and it might be wise to read the relevant material before the respective lecture. THe big advantage of course is that lectures and reading material now really go one-on-one. "],["introduction.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 Theory, Models and Hypotheses 1.2 Doing Research (in the Social Sciences) 1.3 Reading Guide", " 1 Introduction In this first introductory chapter, we will lay out the relations between theory development and theory testing as they are the cornerstones of scientific progress. After all, a theory or idea can only be scientific if the theory can be tested and if need be refuted. If the theory cannot be tested then it is not science. We will also explain the basic workflow of scientific research and the tools needed with specific emphasis on research in the social sciences. We end with a reading guide where we discuss each chapter and the relations between the chapters. 1.1 Theory, Models and Hypotheses In 2021, Guido Imbens, Joshua Angrist and David Card received the Nobel price for economics (officially The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel). The field they work in is applied econometrics with specific focus on finding causal relations. That means that with data they want to test whether phenomenon \\(X\\) has an effect on phenomenon \\(Y\\). And that is what most applied econometric work nowadays is focused on. And we will focus on that as well in Chapter 5, 6 and 7. But how do you know what to test, or, in other words, where do \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) come from? Those phenomena and possible relations originate from scientific theories as you will have in all disciplines. And those theories are typically casts in models—usually in a very abstract manner. Models come in the form of computer simulations (such as with agent-based modeling), real physical models (as with displays), but often models are formulated in mathematical notation with the aim of being as precise, lucid and clear as possible. Chapter 2, 3 and 4 will indeed deal with a specific subset of economic models formulated with mathematical notation. But note that those models are not necessarily theory. Theory is the underlying set of relations and assumptions that can say something the specific structure of models, but very often theory can lead to multiple types of models, each perhaps highlighting different aspects of the underlying theory. An example of such a theory is the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility: each additional unit of the same good is appreciated less by consumers. This theory can be expressed in many mathematical ways but the underlying concept as displayed in Figure 1.1 always remains the same. This type of function, increasing but slower and slower, belongs to the family of concave functions. A function with exponential growth (such as \\(e^{gt}\\) belongs to the family of convex functions). Figure 1.1: Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility So how to related this with each other in scientific research? Well, when doing research you are interested in something that is not yet known (the research gap). Your aim is to (partly) fill this research gap by answering a research question. To answer this research question you need theory (a theoretical framework); what do you need to assume, what are the most important (moderator) variables, how do they relate with each other, and so on and so forth. From this theory you construct a model. Not necessarily a mathematical one. For example, you can also make a model in a Geographical Information System environment where you visualize layers of information that you think are most relevant based upon theory (in this case often previous scientific literature). Or you make a simulation model examining risks of flooding by rivers. The final step is the stage where your model should provide you with some answers. Sometimes they are concerned with optimality (what is the best location of a new road in a GIS environment), prediction (where are river dikes most vulnerable), or with establishing a (causal) relation. And it is the latter that the second part of this course deals with. How can we know that there is a relation between phenomenon \\(X\\) and phenomenon \\(Y\\) and how do we know whether that relation is causal? For that we use applied econometrics (which is a form of applied statistics but then in the social sciences domain–the exact difference will be discussed in Chapter 5). And to establish a, hopefully causal, relation, we test our models with empirical data. The applied econometrics we teach in this course (and in all introductory courses of applied statistics and econometrics all over the world—the “101” courses) is based on so-called frequentist statistics (we will revisit its basic assumptions in Chapter 5). The exact definition is not important for now but know that it is intrinsically related with hypothesis testing. And hypothesis testing is most often associated with that scientific philosopher—and perhaps the only one you know—Karl Popper (as displayed in 1.2). Figure 1.2: Karl Popper Popper was a so-called empiricist and claimed that theories in the empirical sciences (that includes most of the social sciences) can never be proven, only rejected. That is why you can reject a null-hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)), but never accept the alternative hypothesis (\\(H_a\\)). And this is very much related with the theoretical framework behind frequentist statistics. Loosely speaking, in frequentist statistics you construct a world where \\(H_0\\) is true and try to reject that world with data (we will come back to this in Chapter 5)—but that world does not say something the validity of the alternative hypothesis. Now, Popper never claimed that rejecting one null-hypothesis will reject a whole theory. For that you need a larger body of evidence, including results from all sorts of studies—not only statistical ones, leading to a general consensus among the scientific community (Popper 2005). In truth, although the scientific approach of working with null-hypotheses is a very valuable one (and remarkably practical), it does not lead to definitive answers. That is because contradicting models can lead to similar null-hypotheses. Moreover, often the direct connection between research question and null-hypothesis is not a direct one. Consider that you want to know the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\), so your research question is: “What is the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\)?”. But, in a frequentist world you only reject hypotheses—thus leading to results in the line of: “The effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) is not \\(\\ldots\\)”. This makes the evidence for your research question at least circumstantial and in the best cases indirect. The bottom-line here is that one needs to be careful in drawing conclusions based on null-hypotheses (and in a broader sense based on models in general). Scientific research typically advances very slowly—but hopefully in a robust and parsimonious way! 1.2 Doing Research (in the Social Sciences) It is remarkable that, although in principle students are prepared for scientific research, they receive little guidance in how they should do scientific research. What are the tips &amp; tricks of the trade and what—and, more importantly why—should you use specific (types of) applications and what is the relation between them. In our view most of this should belong in your first course upon entering the university (with course title “Methods 101”). And some of it you indeed have learned in your first year, but in our experience students still lack “operational” knowledge. Therefore, we discuss below the four elements we think are among the most important. There are others, but for now this will do. 1.2.1 Work tidy and know where your stuff is Our first and most important tip is to work tidy. Try to make your work look good. And with work we mean everything you submit (such as tutorials, papers, examinations, and theses). And that is because lecturers are just like people and often think from primary instincts with their reptilian brain: if it doesn’t look good, not much time is spent on arguing and thinking as well! Moreover, when your work is difficult to read, lecturers get annoyed. Making your work look good and in the same time more lucid and transparent also serves a higher purpose as it is then easier to detect mistakes. Namely, everyone makes mistakes. The important thing is to detect them early, learn from them and remedy them. This advances science in general and is a very important feature of the scientific process. Chapter 7 will spent additional time on working tidy and making it looking good. A second very straightforward tip is to be organised and to know where your stuff is. Often, students come to us for help with all their files piled on a stack on their desktop and facing difficulties finding where their work is. It is always advisable to use a folder structure and have one folder for one project (course). And to the use sub-folders for data, text, code, pdf’s and so forth. A second tip for organisation is to think about versioning. As the well-known Figure 1.3 shows the number of versions of one file very quickly can get out of hand. Think at least about a consistent naming structure (perhaps with the date involved such as paper_mt_20221215.doc). Figure 1.3: Version confusion 1.2.2 Make notes One skill that in our opinion is given not too much attention is making useful notes. It has been proven that writing things down is beneficial; not only for remembering but also for understanding. And that seems to be best just by using a pen as this slows writing down and you have to think what to write down. Underlining or marking is useful less beneficial than writing accompanying notes. But when should you write notes? Well, when attending lectures of course but also when reading. To leverage your notes as much as possible it is important that you have a system where you can retrieve your notes and compare them with other notes. The latter is the hardest part, but is in the long run the most rewarding as new connections are created between lectures, courses, books, and years. You do not need any fancy tools for this (there is literally a ton of applications to be found on internet), Microsoft’s Onenote or Evernote are more than good enough . Where the workflow typically is to first use pen and paper to capture notes and thereafter rewrite and organise your notes in a notes system. 1.2.3 Use a reference manager Perhaps the tool that has the quickest pay-off is a reference manager. For those of you who are not using one yet: do it. Why? Because you never have to think about your reference list again. All reference managers come with plugins for Word or other text-editors (or type-setters such as \\(\\LaTeX\\) that enable you to automatically generate reference list based upon in-text citations which the reference manager can also provide. You only need less than an hour to set it up, but you very quickly become more efficient (and thus save time in future work). There are many reference managers out there, but we advise Zotero as it is open source. There is both a cloud and desktop version and it comes with a handy tutorial. It also provides a plugin for your browser to automatically import the bibliographic details of the paper you are reading at the moment. 1.2.4 Statistical software As quantitative research become more and more important in the social sciences you need software to manage your data and provides statistical and applied econometric analyses. Ideally, an open-source package is used (such as R or Python), but they have a steep-learning curve and do not work immediately out-of-the-box. The statistical software we use in this course is STATA and is more intuitive (compared to R or Python that is!) and, above all, all economists use it. So, the user base is large and that is important, because for each problem there is much material to be found on internet (including video’s). There is a disadvantage from using STATA and that is that it is not open-source. 1.3 Reading Guide This course will not concern itself with theory as such, but more with methods to describe that theory (the models) and how to test that theory (the applied econometrics). Chapter 2–4 deals with models. "],["surplus.html", "2 Introduction to Economic Surplus 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Consumer choices and consumer value 2.3 Poducer behaviour and surplus 2.4 Analysis of economic surplus 2.5 External costs and economic surplus 2.6 Conclusion", " 2 Introduction to Economic Surplus Practical cost-benefit analysis is widely used in applied economic analysis and often employs a definition of economic surplus that adds up consumer and producer surplus and potential external costs. These lecture notes discuss the behavioural assumptions underlying this calculation and show how to operationalise the definition of economic surplus to derive economic surplus changes and externality taxes. It employs a mathematical approach suitable applied economic partial equilibrium analysis. 2.1 Introduction 2.1.1 Background These lecture notes introduce the classical economic perspective on economic surplus. Economic surplus is a quantitative estimate of the value that markets generate for society according to economists. Besides analysing the impacts of economic policies for societies (do policies have effects and do they work as intended?), one of the core tasks of economists is to give recommendations about what is supposed to be valuable for society (do policies add value?). Economic analyses of the value that markets generate also are important in debates about sustainability. What economists contribute to this debate is that they seek to analyse behavioural choices of consumers and producers using statistical techniques and mathematical modelling and that they come up with quantitative estimates of value. The contribution of these lecture notes is that we move from conceptual analysis of market figures to mathematical descriptions and connections to statistical measurement. We do so for partial equilibrium analysis, meaning that we focus on the analysis of a market for a single good. Four conceptual pillars of economic analysis are important for applied economic analysis of surplus and the lecture notes of this week try to emphasize the structural relation between these pillars along the road: Optimization: market actors choose their best (feasible) option. Equilibrium: market actors choose their best feasible option when interacting with others. Empiricism: behavioural models need to be tested with data. Choice-based normativity: choices express value of market actors and value of market actors is equal to value for society. The first core principle states that consumers and producers optimize when they make their choices. For consumers this implies it is assumed that they maximize their utility. A mathematical description of utility is captured by the direct utility function which maps consumption quantities and remaining money to some cardinal number. We will discuss the mathematical behavioural model underlying consumer optimization in Section II and discuss the implications for consumer value in markets. We also show at some points how this model of consumer behaviour relates to pillar (iii). For producers, pillar (i) implies that they minimize their costs given a production target when they are assumed to be price-takers. Section III discusses the basic cost-minimization model of producers and the implications for producer value in markets. The second core principle states that equilibrium in markets results from the behavioural choices and interaction of consumers and producers. Section IV of these lecture notes discuss partial equilibrium and implications for total economic value in markets. The discussion in these sections of the lecture notes is conceptually speaking rather basic as substitution to other markets is ignored. Some complexity is added by connecting equilibrium to the third pillar of empiricism. It is very important for you to understand the core concepts and assumptions and the calibration underlying a basic partial equilibrium model in order to understand the extensions that are provided in the weeks that follow. The third pillar is discussed along the way. Empirical analysis can be used to estimate the structural parameters of observed demand functions and production functions using regression techniques. These techniques relate mathematical narratives of choice behaviour to empirical data. The mathematical structure that is imposed sometimes requires that parameters in regression have particular values. Hypothesis testing can be used to see which model fits the data better. Calibration can be used to connect estimated elasticities from the literature to market demand and supply functions. Examples are provided to show how you can obtain quantitative estimates of total economic value. Section V applies the model of market value and introduces the idea of external costs. This is a key concept in environmental economics and analyses of sustainability. From an economic perspective, external costs resulting from market trade lower the value of a market and can be a motivating factor for regulatory intervention of a government. For a classical economist a sustainable market is a market where external costs are correctly priced. Section V discusses the regulation of an environmental externality in a market and thereby provides the necessary bridge between the economic theory and your bachelor program. Analytical examples are provided to show how you can obtain quantitative estimates of total economic value. We will come back to the four pillars in the weeks that follow where we zoom in on the impact of bounded rationality and other views on normativity. 2.2 Consumer choices and consumer value 2.2.1 Utility functions, inverse demand and demand Why do consumers choose to consume particular meat products? What is the consumer value of newly developed vegan product? How does households’ demand for solar panels respond to price decreases? To study these research questions, it is helpful to develop a model of consumer choice. For economists, models of choice are mathematical narratives about how consumers make their choices. The story of consumer choice by economists assumes that consumers optimize the choice value that they derive from the consumption of market goods given constraints they face. In this section the consumer story is partly simplified and we investigate the decision of the consumer to spend money on the market good versus spending money on other goods or services given a budget constraint. We therefore do not study market goods that are close complements or close substitutes. Value is mathematically conceptualized using a direct utility function that depends on the consumption levels. The direct utility function of the consumer is defined by \\(U(Q,G)\\), where \\(Q\\) is the demand for the market good and \\(G\\) is the demand for the outside good. The price of the market good is given by \\(p\\) and the price of the outside good is given by \\(p_G\\). Both prices are given for the consumer and cannot be directly affected by their behaviour. This assumption rules out forms of bilateral bargaining about the market price between consumers and producers. The price for the outside good can be interpreted as the costs or price index for a basket of goods for the consumers, where the market good is excluded from this basket. When prices of products in the basket increase over time, this will impact the price of the outside good. Net spendable income of the consumer is assumed to be exogenous and given by \\(Y\\). This income is after tax income and can be used freely by the consumer. Total spending of the consumer is given by \\(pQ+p_G G\\), because it is assumed that all net income is spent either on the market good or the outside good. The budget constraint of the individual is then given by: \\[\\begin{equation} Y - pQ - p_G G = 0. \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] From this budget constraint we can derive the consumed quantity of the outside good \\(G\\): \\[\\begin{equation} G = \\frac{Y-pQ}{p_G} \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] The quantity consumed of the outside good increases in the income level \\(Y\\), decreases in the price of the basket of goods \\(p_G\\), and decreases in consumer spending \\(pQ\\) on the market good. Substituting this quantity in the direct utility gives us an expression that only has the quantity level of the market good as a choice variable: \\[\\begin{equation} U \\left(Q, \\frac{Y-pQ}{p_G} \\right) \\end{equation}\\] The optimal choice of the quantity of the market good is governed by the utility of consumption (first argument) and the disutility of spending money on the market good (second argument). Optimal consumption can be derived by setting the total derivative with respect to the market quantity to 0: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dU}{dQ} = U_Q - \\frac{P}{P_G}U_G = 0 \\end{equation}\\] Here, \\(U_Q=\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Q}\\) is the marginal utility of consuming the market good. Here we use the notation \\(\\frac{dU}{dQ}\\) for the total derivative (both arguments of the utility function), and the notation \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Q}\\) for the partial derivative with respect to \\(Q\\) (only the first argument). Marginal utility of consumption is the slope of the direct utility function with respect to the first argument \\(Q\\). Furthermore, \\(U_G=\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial G}\\) is the marginal utility of consumption of the outside good. This is equal to the price of the outside good multiplied with the marginal utility of income \\(p_G \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Y}\\). The second part of the first-order condition therefore captures the disutility of paying a price \\(p\\) for the market good. It also accounts for the relative price of the market good compared to the price for the basket of goods. From the first-order condition an implicit expression for the inverse demand curve can be derived. This expression shows that the ratio of prices is equal to the ration of marginal utilities. \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{p}{p_G} = \\frac{U_Q}{U_G} \\longleftrightarrow p = p_G\\frac{U_Q}{U_G} \\end{equation}\\] An implicit solution means that the price \\(p\\) potentially appears at the right-hand side of the equation. This inverse demand curve is the maximum marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for the good. It depends on the relative size of the marginal utilities and increases in the price of the basket of goods. For many practical purposes the price of the basket of goods is normalized to \\(p_G=1\\) resulting in inverse demand as a function of the ratio of marginal utilities: \\[\\begin{equation} p = \\frac{U_Q}{U_G} \\end{equation}\\] The MWTP can be employed as a measure of consumer benefits. Much of the analytical work of demand analysists focusses on particular specifications that result in explicit solutions for the inverse demand curve. These explicit solutions have only exogenous parameters and quantity \\(Q\\) at the right-hand side and can be analysed using empirical data. 2.2.2 Examples of demand and inverse demand functions To illustrate the model, we provide an example of three particular utility functions. First, we discuss a direct utility function without income effects and exponential marginal utility of consumption. Second, we discuss the well-known Cobb-Douglas utility function. This utility function captures non-linear impacts of net spendable income on direct utility. Third, we discuss a specification of the direct utility function that captures minimum threshold levels for consumption. Such a specification is particularly relevant for particular basic goods that a consumer cannot do without. 2.2.2.1 The exponential-linear utility function Suppose direct utility is specified as: \\[\\begin{equation} U(Q,G) = \\frac{A}{\\alpha}\\left( 1- e^{-\\alpha Q} \\right ) + BG \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] The marginal utility of consumption is given by the partial derivative with respect to the market good: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Q} = Ae^{-\\alpha Q} &gt; 0. \\end{equation}\\] This marginal utility is positive implying that direct utility increases when consumption of the market good increases. The marginal utility of the outside good is given by the partial derivative with respect to \\(G\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial G} = B &gt; 0. \\end{equation}\\] It is also positive implying more of the outside good is considered to be better. The direct utility is concave1 in the consumption of the market good and linear in the consumption of the outside good. This can be proved by investigating the second-order partial derivatives which are negative for consumption (first argument) and 0 for the outside good (second argument): \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial Q^2} = - \\alpha Ae^{-\\alpha Q} &lt; 0, \\qquad \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial G^2} = 0. \\end{equation}\\] The intuitive appeal of the assumption of concavity is that the additional utility gained from consuming an additional unit of the market good is decreasing in the consumption level. This implies that the marginal utility of consuming the market good is positive, but decreasing. For example, people might enjoy eating meat, but the additional enjoyment of meat consumption decreases in the consumption level. At some point meat saturation kicks in and marginal utility becomes (close to) 0. In line with pillar (1.), the consumer is assumed to maximize utility while accounting for the budget constraint. From the budget constraint we can obtain the consumption level of the outside good: \\[\\begin{equation} Y - pQ - G = 0 \\longleftrightarrow G= Y - pQ. \\end{equation}\\] Substituting gives: \\[\\begin{equation} U(Q,G)=\\frac{A}{\\alpha}(1-e^{-\\alpha Q})+B(Y - p Q). \\end{equation}\\] The first-order condition for utility maximisation is given by the total derivative of the direct utility function with respect to the market good: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dU}{dQ} = Ae^{\\alpha Q} - pB. \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] The first positive part is the marginal utility of consumption which is positive and the second negative part the marginal utility of payments for the market good. From the first-order condition one can solve for the inverse demand curve which expresses price \\(p\\) as a function of quantity \\(Q\\). Furthermore, one can also solve for the demand curve which expresses quantity as a function of the price. In order to have a unique solution we have to check the second-order total derivative: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dU^2}{dQ^2} = -\\alpha Ae^{\\alpha Q} &lt; 0. \\end{equation}\\] This second-order total derivative is negative, implying that the optimum is a unique maximum. We start with solving for the inverse demand curve \\(p(Q)\\)2, which is given by:3 \\[\\begin{equation} p(Q)=\\frac{A}{B} e^{-\\alpha Q}. \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] Now we have an explicit solution for the MWTP because the right-hand side of this equation only depends on \\(Q\\) and exogenous utility parameters. At \\(Q=0\\), the MWTP is highest and equal to \\(\\frac{A}{B}\\). For higher values of \\(Q\\), the MWTP decreases which is in line with decreasing marginal benefits of consumption. The parameter \\(\\alpha\\) governs the steepness of this decrease. The higher the parameter \\(\\alpha\\) is, the steeper the decrease of the marginal benefits. Using the first-order condition for utility maximisation (2.4), one can also derive the demand curve (again, by setting \\(\\frac{dU}{dQ} = 0\\) and then isolating \\(Q\\)): \\[\\begin{equation} Q(p)=\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\ln(A) - \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\ln(p) - \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\ln(B) \\end{equation}\\] This expression shows that demand for the market good: Decreases in the price \\(p\\) as \\(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial p} =-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{1}{p}&lt;0\\); Increases in the utility parameter \\(A\\) as \\(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial A} =\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\frac{1}{A} &gt;0\\); Decreases in the utility parameter \\(B\\) as \\(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial A} =-\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\frac{1}{B} &lt;0\\); Decreases in the utility parameter \\(\\alpha\\) as \\(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial \\alpha} =-\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2} \\left( \\ln(A) - \\ln(p) - \\ln (B) \\right) &lt;0\\); As this point it is useful to see how this analytical result can be connected to the third pillar: empiricism. The demand function can be empirically estimated using statistical techniques and data on quantities and prices. Suppose an empirical economist estimates the following linear-log regression: \\[\\begin{equation} Q = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\ln p + \\epsilon. \\tag{2.6} \\end{equation}\\] From equation (2.6) one can derive some of the utility parameters. The parameter \\(\\beta_1\\) is expected to be negative as demand decreases in the price. The mathematical model suggests that this parameter should be equal to \\(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\). We can therefore write \\(\\alpha = -\\frac{1}{\\beta_1} &gt; 0\\). The constant parameter \\(\\beta_0\\) is—according to the behavioural model—equal to \\(\\beta_0 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\ln(\\frac{A}{B})\\). We can therefore write \\(\\ln \\frac{A}{B} = \\alpha \\beta_0\\) or \\(\\frac{A}{B} = e^{\\alpha \\beta_0} = e^{-\\frac{1}{\\beta_1}\\beta_0}\\). The estimated parameters resulting from the regression equation therefore have a one-to-one correspondence to the underlying utility maximisation problem. An assumption that needs to be made is that the error \\(\\epsilon\\) in the regression equation is irrelevant for the analysis and captures particular measurement errors at the side of the researcher. If this is not the case, errors capture another part of the marginal utility and things become more complicated.4 Dealing with unknown regression noise therefore already leads to interesting epistemological questions for applied economic research that we will assume away for now. Furthermore, the behavioural model analyses individual choice behaviour and therefore the measurement of prices and demand should ideally be done at the individual level to stay close to the behavioural mathematical narrative that is developed. 2.2.2.2 The Cobb-Douglas utility function One of the disadvantages of the introduced direct utility function of the previous section, is that the marginal utility of consumption of the outside good is assumed to be constant for each consumption level of the market good. The behavioural narrative therefore does not account for the plausible intuition that consumers with a lower income derive more utility from an income increase compared to consumers with a lower income (see for example Layard, Mayraz, and Nickell (2008)). In order to account for this, we propose a Cobb-Douglas type utility function that captures decreasing marginal utility for the market good and the outside good and directly substitute the expression for the outside good:5 \\[\\begin{equation} U(Q,G) = A\\ln(Q) + B\\ln(G) = A \\ln(Q) + B \\ln (Y - p Q). \\end{equation}\\] The first-order condition is now given by the following total derivative: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{d U}{d Q} = \\frac{A}{Q} - \\frac{B p}{Y - p Q} = 0. \\tag{2.7} \\end{equation}\\] Solving this first-order condition for the quantity level gives the following demand function:6 \\[\\begin{equation} Q(p) = \\frac{A}{A + B}\\frac{Y}{p}. \\end{equation}\\] The demand curve depends on the exogenous utility parameters \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), increases in the income level \\(Y\\) and decreases in the price \\(p\\). Higher income levels therefore result in higher demand for the market good. The consumer spends \\(p Q(p)=\\frac{A}{A+B} Y\\) on the market good. From the budget constraint we can work back the spending on the outside good which are equal to \\(Y-pQ=\\frac{B}{A+B} Y\\). This is an attractive aspect of the Cobb-Douglas specification: expenditure shares on the market good are directly related to relative utility parameters $. For empirical purposes, the demand curve can be estimated using econometric techniques. Log-linearizing the demand curve gives the following regression equation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln Q = \\ln(\\frac{A}{A+B}) + \\ln Y - \\ln p + \\epsilon. \\end{equation}\\] The Cobb-Douglas specification of utility therefore requires that the parameters for income and price in the demand function are \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\) respectively. This can be tested using statistical hypothesis testing. The inverse demand curve for this particular utility function is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} p(Q) = \\frac{A}{A + B}\\frac{Y}{Q}. \\end{equation}\\] A disadvantage of this specification from a behavioural perspective is that the MWTP for the first marginal unit of the good is infinite. This is because when \\(Q \\longrightarrow 0\\) then \\(p(Q) \\longrightarrow \\infty\\). An advantage of this specification is that the MWTP for the market good is increasing in the net spendable income \\(Y\\). For environmentally sustainable goods it is expected that this will be a plausible assumption. 2.2.2.3 A utility function that allows for minimum consumption tresholds We continue the discussion on demand models with a third example. It might be that individuals need to consume a minimum amount of particular basic goods such as food or energy. The Stone-Geary utility function is able to deal with this. Again, we use a log-linearized version of the utility function: \\[\\begin{equation} U(Q,G) = A \\ln (Q - \\underline{Q}) + B \\ln (G - \\underline{G}), \\end{equation}\\] In this equation \\(\\underline{Q} &lt;Y\\) is the minimum amount needed of the market good and \\(\\underline{G}&lt;Y\\) the minimum amount needed for the outside good. This minimum amount of the outside good can be interpreted as consumer spending needed for basic goods which are not the market good. Utility goes to minus infinity when consumption is lower or equal to these minimum amounts. Substituting \\(G=Y-pQ\\) from the budget constraint gives: \\[\\begin{equation} U(Q,G) = A \\ln (Q - \\underline{Q}) + B \\ln (Y - p Q - \\underline{G}), \\end{equation}\\] The first-order condition is given by the following total derivative: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{d U }{d Q} = \\frac{A}{Q - \\underline{Q}} - \\frac{B p}{Y - pQ - \\underline{G}} = 0, \\end{equation}\\] which can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} bpQ - bp\\underline{Q} = AY - ApQ - A\\underline{G}. \\end{equation}\\] Rearranging gives: \\[\\begin{equation} Qp(B+ A) = AY = Bp\\underline{Q} - A\\underline{G}. \\end{equation}\\] Solving for the demand gives: \\[\\begin{equation} Q(p) = \\frac{A}{A+B}\\frac{Y}{p} + \\frac{B}{A+B}\\underline{Q} - \\frac{A}{A+B}\\frac{1}{p}\\underline{G}. \\end{equation}\\] The first term of the demand function is equal to the standard Cobb-Douglas demand derived in the previous section. The second term accounts for the threshold consumption of the market good. Market demand increases in the threshold demand \\(\\underline{Q}\\). The third term shows that market demand decreases in the threshold demand \\(\\underline{G}\\) as more money is needed to consume basic goods in the basket of outside goods. When the market good is not necessary and \\(\\underline{Q} = 0\\), market demand can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} Q(p) = \\frac{A}{A+B}\\frac{Y}{p} - \\frac{A}{A+B}\\frac{1}{p}\\underline{G} = \\frac{A}{A+B}\\frac{1}{p}\\left(Y - \\underline{G} \\right). \\end{equation}\\] Log-linearizing this demand function gives the following regression equation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln Q = \\ln \\frac{A}{A+B} + \\ln(Y - \\underline{G} - \\ln p + \\epsilon). \\end{equation}\\] Demand is not linear in the log of the net spendable income anymore as first the necessary spending on the outside good should be accounted for. The price coefficient and the coefficient for \\(\\ln (Y - \\underline{G})\\) still enter with a coefficient equal to \\(1\\). For applied work this means that if the Stone-Geary model of behaviour is correct, one first should subtract spending on basic goods \\(\\underline{G}\\) from the net spendable income, and introduce the logged variable as an explanatory variable in the regression. 2.2.2.4 Demand modelling: conclusion The take away of these three examples is that particular specifications of the direct utility function result in equations for individual demand curves that can be empirically operationalized and estimated making additional assumptions. Some specifications of the direct utility function are behaviourally more plausible whereas other specifications might be easier to operationalize using empirical data. This is the reason that economists prefer to have multiple modelling options in their toolbox. 2.2.3 Consumer benefits and surplus in markets 2.2.3.1 Market demand and elasticities The behavioural models of the previous section can be viewed as models of individual choice behaviour. The demand and inverse demand functions are therefore in principal specified at the individual level. For the analysis of markets, these functions are aggregated into a market (inverse) demand function. This implies that when we analyse market quantities and prices in regression analysis, additional assumptions should be made to relate the results of these regressions to the underlying distribution of utility parameters in the population. Developing models that account for a correct mathematical aggregation to market demand curves often requires stringent assumptions on preferences. Consider for example the Cobb-Douglas demand that is developed in section 2.2.2.2 and denote \\(Q_n (p)=\\frac{A_n}{A_n+B_n} Y_n \\frac{1}{p}\\) as the individual demand. Assume we have a population of \\(N\\) individuals. The market demand can be given as the sum of the individual demands: \\[\\begin{equation} Q^D(p) = \\sum_{n= 1}^{N}\\frac{A_n}{A_n+B_n} Y_n \\frac{1}{p}=\\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{n= 1}^{N}\\frac{A_n}{A_n+B_n} Y_n. \\end{equation}\\] Although aggregation is possible, it requires additional analytical assumption to be neatly done. Because of complexity we avoid this aggregation discussion by neglecting the behavioural model underlying the decision of the population of consumers. We continue by directly interpreting the market inverse demand curve that is estimated in regressions as the total MWTP for the market good and assume the regression constant adjusts for aggregation issues. From now on we therefore use \\(p(Q)\\) to denote the market inverse demand curve. This market inverse demand curve measures what the price of the market good would have to be for \\(Q\\) units of it to be demanded (Varian (2003), 2006, p.268). Consumers can buy the good multiple times and are sorted along the inverse demand curve on the basis of their MWTP where the intuition for the derivation of the MWTP stems from the behavioural model that is developed. The MWTPs estimated from regressions of market demand can then be interpreted as measures of consumer benefits. The total consumer benefits for the market good are in turn given by the sum of the benefits of all consumers who participate in the market. Besides looking at market data, one could also operationalise the intuition of MWTP using survey research. In a survey we could for example ask people to express their WTP for an additional unit of consumption and sort the WTPs to obtain the inverse demand function. For example, we could ask the following question: What would be your maximum willingness to pay for an additional unit of these vegan chicken nuggets? The answers to these questions can serve as an input to derive the inverse demand curve and the demand curve. For applied work we are often interested in the price elasticity of market demand. This is defined by:7 \\[\\begin{equation} \\epsilon = \\frac{\\partial Q^D}{\\partial p} \\frac{p}{Q^D(p)}. \\end{equation}\\] The definition of an elasticity is as follows: for a 1% increase in the market price, the market demand will change with \\(\\epsilon\\)%. For many market goods, this elasticity will be negative as higher prices result in lower demand. When the elasticity is lower than \\(-1\\), the market good has elastic demand. When the elasticity is in between 0 and \\(-1\\), it has inelastic demand. We illustrate the concept of price elasticity of demand using an example. Brons et al. (2002) give an overview of price elasticities of demand for air travel. Figure 2.1 below is from their paper. Figure 2.1: Overview of studies on the price elasticities of market demand for air travel For short distance air travel the median value of the price elasticity is \\(-1.5\\). This implies that for short distance travel a \\(1\\)% increase in the price will reduce air travel for these trips with \\(1.5\\)%. For medium-distance trips the median price elasticity of market demand is given by \\(-1.4\\) implying that a \\(1\\)% increase in the price reduces demand with \\(1.4\\)%. For long-distance flights the median is \\(-0.8\\), implying that a \\(1\\)% increase in the price reduces demand with \\(0.8\\)%. For the assumed numbers above, long-distance flight demand is therefore inelastic whereas short distance and medium distance flights have elastic demands. are therefore less sensitive to the price compared to travellers. Another example of estimated price elasticities comes from a meta-analysis of Andreyeva, Long, and Brownell (2010). They give a summary of estimates of absolute price elasticities of demand for food categories in the US (displayed in Figure 2.2). All food categories have inelastic demand as elasticities are in between \\(0\\) and \\(-1\\). The estimated price elasticities are between \\(-0.27\\) (eggs) and \\(-0.81\\) (food away from home). A \\(1\\)% increase in the price of eggs therefore results in \\(0.27\\)% lower demand. For beef the estimated elasticity is \\(-0.75\\), implying that a \\(1\\)% increase in the price for beef results in a \\(0.75\\)% lower demand. Uncertainty in the estimates is reported with the 95% confidence intervals. Figure 2.2: Price elasticity estimates for food categories. 2.2.3.2 Deriving consumer benefits Total consumer benefits in the market are given by all the consumer benefits of those who buy the market good. An analogous continuous representation of total consumer benefits is given by the integral under the inverse market demand function from 0 to the equilibrium quantity: \\[\\begin{equation} CB = \\int_0^{Q\\ast} p(Q) dQ. \\end{equation}\\] For example, when the inverse demand curve is given by \\(p(Q)=\\frac{A}{B} e^{-\\alpha Q}\\), consumer benefits can be derived analytically by using the primitive function of the inverse demand function: \\[\\begin{align} CB &amp;= \\int_0^{Q^\\ast} \\frac{A}{B} e^{-\\alpha Q} = \\left[-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{A}{B}e^{-\\alpha Q} + z \\right]_0^{Q^\\ast} \\\\ &amp;= \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{A}{B}e^{-\\alpha Q^\\ast} + z \\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{A}{B}e^{-\\alpha 0} + z \\right)\\\\ &amp;=\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{A}{B}e^{-\\alpha Q^\\ast} \\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{A}{B} 1 \\right) \\\\ &amp;=\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{A}{B}e^{-\\alpha Q^\\ast} \\right) +\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{A}{B} \\\\ &amp;= - \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{A}{B}\\left[e^{-\\alpha Q^\\ast} -1 \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{A}{B}\\left[ 1 - e^{-\\alpha Q^\\ast}\\right]. \\end{align}\\] The process of the derivation of the primitive function can be viewed as reverse differentiation: the derivative of the primitive function gives back the original function (in our case the inverse demand function). It therefore can only be derived up to a particular constant \\(z\\). The primitive function should be evaluated at the equilibrium demand \\(Q\\ast\\) and the point \\(0\\). The difference between these function evaluations gives the area under the inverse demand function from \\(0\\) to \\(Q\\ast\\). The third step shows that the constant \\(z\\) then drops out and is therefore irrelevant for the outcomes. The final result shows that consumer benefits can be numerically estimated when the parameters \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\frac{A}{B}\\) and \\(Q\\ast\\) are known. From our earlier discussion on this inverse demand function, we had \\(\\alpha=-\\frac{1}{\\beta_1} &gt;0\\) and \\(\\frac{A}{B}=e^{-\\frac{\\beta_0}{\\beta_1}} &gt;0\\). As \\(0 &lt; e^{-\\alpha Q\\ast} &lt;1\\). Therefore, in line with intuition, consumer benefits always will be positive. Substituting the regression parameters in the expression for the consumer benefits gives an estimate for consumer benefits as a function of the observed/derived equilibrium quantity and the regression parameters of the market demand function: \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{CB} = -\\hat{\\beta}_1 e^{-\\frac{\\beta_0}{\\beta_1}}\\left[1- e^{-\\frac{Q\\ast}{\\beta_1}} \\right]. \\end{equation}\\] Using regression techniques in combination with assumptions on the market inverse demand curve, economists are therefore able to estimate the consumer benefits of consumption of a market good. It is important to account for the dimensions of this expression. When consumption levels are given per year and prices are given in euros, the consumer benefits for the particular market are given in euros per year. For example, consider the market for vegan chick nuggets. Assume that the total market quantity for these nuggets is given by \\(200,000\\) pieces sold per year in The Netherlands. The estimated parameters are given by \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1=-0.08\\) and \\(\\beta_0 =1.44\\). Substituting in the equation for the consumer benefits gives: \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{CB} = 0.08 e^{-\\frac{1.44}{-0.08}}\\left[1- e^{-\\frac{200,000}{-0.08}} \\right] = 5,252,798 \\text{ euros per year}. \\end{equation}\\] For this example, the market for vegan nuggets in the Netherlands therefore results in consumer benefits of about \\(5.25\\) million euros per year. 2.2.3.3 Deriving changes in consumer benefits. Sometimes researchers are interested in changes in consumer benefits rather than the level of consumer benefits. This is especially relevant for particular policy recommendations/interventions where the change in value compared to doing nothing is analysed. Suppose there is a change in equilibrium quantity from \\(Q^\\ast\\) to \\(Q^{\\ast\\ast}\\). The change in consumer benefits can then be derived using rules of integrals and is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta CB = \\int_0^{Q^{\\ast\\ast}} p(Q)dQ - \\int_0^{Q^\\ast} p(Q)dQ = \\int_{Q^\\ast}^{Q^{\\ast\\ast}} p(Q)dQ. \\end{equation}\\] Suppose we employ a stable Cobb-Douglas inverse demand curve over time which is derived in the previous section and defined as: \\(p(Q)=\\frac{A}{A+B}\\frac{Y}{Q}\\). The change in consumer benefits can then be derived analytically: \\[\\begin{align} \\Delta CB &amp;= \\int_{Q^\\ast}^{Q^{\\ast\\ast}} \\frac{A}{A+B}\\frac{Y}{Q} dQ = \\left[\\frac{A}{A+B} Y \\ln Q = z \\right]^{Q^{\\ast\\ast}}_{Q^\\ast} = \\frac{A}{A+B} Y \\left[\\ln Q^{\\ast\\ast} - \\ln Q^\\ast \\right] \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{A}{A+B} Y \\left[\\ln \\left(\\frac{Q^{\\ast\\ast}}{Q^\\ast}\\right) \\right]. \\end{align}\\] This uses the fact that the primitive function of \\(\\frac{1}{Q}\\) is given by \\(\\ln(Q)\\). The last step is taken using rules of working with logarithms: \\(ln(x)-ln(y)=ln(x/y)\\). Again, the primitive function is derived of which the derivative gives back the inverse demand function. The change in consumer benefits is positive when \\(Q^{\\ast\\ast}&gt;Q^\\ast\\), and negative when \\(Q^{\\ast\\ast}&lt;Q^\\ast\\). For this particular specification of the utility function the change is proportionally increasing in the income level. In order to operationalise this equation, one has to account for the dimension of the quantity level and the dimension of the income variable. For the budget constraint the net spendable income is relevant. Suppose income in the regression is given by net spendable income per month and is equal to \\(Y=3,500\\) euros. Furthermore, suppose there is an increase in the consumption of vegan nuggets from \\(200,000\\) pieces per year in 2019 to \\(250,000\\) pieces per year in 2020. For the analysis of consumer benefits, we need the equality =e^{_0}, where \\(\\beta_0\\) is the constant of the regression. An econometrician estimates the following regression: \\[\\begin{equation} Q = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\ln p + \\beta_2 \\ln Y + \\epsilon, \\end{equation}\\] and finds \\(beta_0 = 5.2\\), \\(\\beta_1 =-1.02\\) and \\(\\beta_2 = 0.97\\). The constant is therefore estimated at \\(beta_0=5.2\\). The parameters before the logged price and the logged income are not significantly different from \\(1\\). Therefore, we can assume Cobb-Douglas preferences describe choice behaviour correctly. The next step is to substitute the numerical values for \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(Q^\\ast\\) and \\(Q^{\\ast\\ast}\\) in the expression for the change in consumer benefits. This results in: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta CB = e^{5.2} 3500 \\left[\\ln \\frac{250000}{200000} \\right] = 141574 \\text{ euros per year}. \\end{equation}\\] This example shows how regression results can be connected to empirical estimates of consumer benefits. 2.2.3.4 Deriving consumer surplus Until now we have not accounted for the fact that the consumer also pays a price for the product. Consumer surplus is defined as the total consumer benefits minus the total consumer costs: \\[\\begin{equation} CS = \\int^Q^\\ast_0 p(Q)dQ - p^\\ast Q^\\ast. \\end{equation}\\] Here \\(p^\\ast\\) is the equilibrium price that is observed and \\(Q^\\ast\\) the equilibrium quantity. In order to calculate consumer surplus for our vegan chicken nuggets example, this requires input on the equilibrium price. Suppose the equilibrium price is equal to \\(2\\) euros per unit. Consumer surplus for The Netherlands is then given by: \\[\\begin{equation} CS=5,252,798-2 \\times 200,000=1,252,798 \\text{ euros per year}. \\end{equation}\\] To conclude: the mathematical analysis of consumer choice behaviour is useful to structure our thinking about consumer behaviour and the origins of the market inverse demand curve. This market inverse demand curve can be interpreted as the MWTP of a group of consumers with MWTPs sorted from high to low and can be estimated using regression techniques or studied using survey questions. Mathematical modelling can be employed to relate estimated parameters in regressions to the calculation of (changes) in consumer benefits where it is important to account for the dimensions of the variables. 2.3 Poducer behaviour and surplus 2.3.1 Producer cost functions and cost minimisation The next step is to analyse the behaviour of producers in the market. This section discusses the classical economic model that helps to understand the economic aspects of decisions of producers. It is assumed that producers minimize their costs given a production target. We start simple by assuming that there are two inputs for the production function: capital \\(K\\) and labour \\(L\\). The production function gives the production output as a function of the inputs: \\(f(K,L)\\). The production costs for the firm are given by the cost function \\(C(K,L)\\) which shows the costs for a given combination of inputs. This cost function captures the costs of capital—which are usually dependent on interest rates—and the costs of labour which can be interpreted as wages and/or overhead. Suppose the firm seeks to produce a target quantity for the market equal to \\(Q\\). According to the model, the firm then will minimize the costs with respect to capital \\(K\\) and labour \\(L\\), but given the production constraint that the target quantity is equal to the production output. Formally, this can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle{\\min_{K,L} C(K,L)} \\text{ subject to }f(K,L) = Q. \\end{equation}\\] As there is a constrained involved, this minimisation problem can be analysed using Lagrangian techniques. This technique rewrites the constrained optimisation problem as an unconstrained optimisation problem. First, the Lagrangian function \\(H\\) needs to be defined. The first part of this Lagrangian function gives the goal function that needs to be minimized or maximized. The second part of this function adds a new variable \\(\\lambda\\) to the optimisation problem and multiplies this variable with the constraint: \\[\\begin{equation} H = C(K,L) + \\lambda(Q - f(K,L)). \\end{equation}\\] The original optimisation problem of the firm is then mathematically reformulated as an unconstrained problem: \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle{\\min_{\\lambda, K,L} H}. \\end{equation}\\] To solve this unconstrained minimisation problem, we need to analyse the familiar first-order conditions with respect to capital, labour and the new variable \\(\\lambda\\) (which is the so-called Lagrangian multiplier). The three first-order conditions are given by: \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\lambda} &amp;=Q - f(K,L) = 0,\\\\ \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial K} &amp;= \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial K} - \\lambda\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial K}= 0,\\\\ \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial L} &amp;= \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial L} - \\lambda\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial L}= 0.\\\\ \\end{align}\\] The first first-order condition with respect to the Lagrangian multiplier guarantees that in equilibrium, the production target is always reached. The reason is that this condition states that the production target \\(Q\\) should be equal to the production level \\(f(K,L)\\). The second condition guarantees optimal choice of capital by equation the marginal costs (or ‘price’) of capital with the marginal benefits. The third condition has a similar structure and equates the marginal costs of labour with the marginal benefits of labour. Assume a linear cost function with input prices equal to \\(r\\) for capital and \\(\\omega\\) for labour. When the cost function is linear in inputs and input prices, the second and the third first-order condition can be rewritten: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{r}{\\omega} = \\frac{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial K}}{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial L}}. \\end{equation}\\] Or in other words: the ratio of input prices is equal to the ratio of marginal productivities of the two respective inputs, which is the marginal rate of substitution. This result shares similarities with the result for consumer optimisation where the ratio of prices is equal to the ratio of marginal utilities. Before moving on to an analytical example it is useful to reflect on the idea of the cost function. In the analysis it is assumed that the cost function only depends on the inputs. This assumption implies that firms neglect potential negative costs of production as the cost function itself is not a function of \\(Q\\). 2.3.2 Specifying and interpreting the production function To make things a bit less abstract we develop an example assuming a Cobb-Douglas type of production function and a linear cost function with input prices equal to \\(r\\) for capital and \\(\\omega\\) for labour. Before moving into technical derivations, it is useful to interpret the production function in more detail in order to better understand what it captures. The Cobb-Douglas type production function is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} f(K,L) = TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L} \\qquad T &gt;0. \\end{equation}\\] This function has several properties. First, both inputs are \\(necessary\\) in order to have positive production. When there is no capital investment or no labour available, production is not possible and equals \\(0\\). Second, the parameter \\(T&gt;0\\) captures the state of overall production technology of the firm. For a given combination of inputs \\(K\\) and \\(L\\), a higher parameter \\(T\\) implies higher production levels. Improvements in overall technology therefore can result in higher production levels at the same level of inputs. Third, together with the parameter \\(T\\), and the input levels \\(K\\) and \\(L\\), \\(\\alpha_K\\) and \\(\\alpha_L\\) determine the marginal production impact of increasing input levels. It is plausible to assume that production is increasing in the input levels. The first derivatives with respect to the inputs show that production is increasing in the inputs: \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial K} &amp;= \\frac{\\alpha_K}{ K} TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L} &gt;0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial L} &amp;= \\frac{\\alpha_L}{ L} TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L} &gt;0 \\\\ \\end{align}\\] To have increasing production in the inputs \\(K\\) and \\(L\\) the parameters \\(\\alpha_K\\) and \\(\\alpha_L\\) should therefore be positive. Fourth, the production function should plausibly be concave in the level of each production input. An additional unit of an input will have lower impacts when there is already a high level of the input present. This can be investigated by looking at the second derivatives: \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial K^2} &amp;= \\frac{\\alpha_K(\\alpha_K -1)}{ K^2} TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L} &lt; 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial L^2} &amp;= \\frac{\\alpha_L(\\alpha_L - 1)}{ L^2} TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L} &lt; 0 \\\\ \\end{align}\\] In order to have concave impacts we should make the assumptions \\(\\alpha_K&lt;1\\) and \\(\\alpha_L&lt;1\\). Fifth, the inputs in the Cobb-Douglas production function are complements. We can investigate this mathematically by looking at the cross-derivatives of the production function which are given by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial K \\partial L} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial L \\partial K} = \\frac{\\alpha_K}{K}\\frac{\\alpha_L}{L} TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L} &gt;0 \\end{equation}\\] These cross-derivatives are positive showing that the marginal productivity of the inputs increases in the levels of the other inputs. Therefore, the inputs are complements. Sixth, the substitution parameters \\(\\alpha_L\\) and \\(\\alpha_K\\) of the production function have a very useful economic interpretation. They are the elasticity of production with respect to the inputs. This elasticity is defined as the percentage change in production for a percentage change in one of the inputs. For example, for labour it is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial L} \\frac{L}{f(K,L)} = \\frac{\\alpha_L}{L}TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L}\\frac{L}{TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L}} =\\alpha_L. \\end{equation}\\] Similarly, for capital we find: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial K} \\frac{K}{f(K,L)} = \\frac{\\alpha_K}{K}TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L}\\frac{K}{TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L}} =\\alpha_K. \\end{equation}\\] In the next section we will show that these elasticities play a key role in the determination of the shape of the cost function with respect to quantity produced. Seventh, we can investigate whether there are increasing, decreasing or constant returns to scale in production levels. When we multiply all the inputs with a fixed factor \\(t&gt;1\\) (for example multiplying the levels of the inputs with 2), the production function can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} f(K,L) = T(tK)^{\\alpha_K}(tL)^{\\alpha_L} = t^{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L} \\end{equation}\\] Multiplying the inputs with a factor \\(t\\), therefore leads to a multiplication of production of \\(t^{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}\\).8 When \\(\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L &lt;1\\), there will be decreasing returns to scale in production as a multiplication of the inputs with a factor \\(t\\), leads to a multiplication of production less than \\(t\\). When \\(\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L &lt;1\\), there is constant returns to scale in production and multiplication of the inputs with \\(t\\) leads to multiplication of production levels with \\(t\\). When \\(\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L &gt;1\\), there will be increasing returns to scale in production as a multiplication of the inputs with a factor \\(t\\), leads to a multiplication of production with more than \\(t\\). Again the input elasticities play a key role here. 2.3.3 The cost function The next step is to specify the cost function of the firm and derive the optimal cost function. We do this, because often only the costs of the firm can be observed (but not the optimal inputs). Furthermore, the cost optimal cost function plays a key role for the market behaviour of the firm. It is assumed to be linear in expenditures on the inputs (for our case labour and capital): \\(c(K,L)=rK+\\omega L\\). This is a reasonable assumption unless the firm can negotiate lower prices for higher amounts of the inputs. In empirical work researchers sometimes specify input prices as a function of the total market demand for these inputs (see Pillai (2015)). Furthermore, it is assumed that costs related to production which fall outside the firm are not included. If the firm does take these costs into account, an additional term related to the target quantity can be added to the cost function and the choice of optimal target quantity can be included in the analysis. The Lagrangian function that describes the constrained optimisation problem of the firm as an unconstrained optimisation problem can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} H = rK+\\omega L + \\lambda (Q - TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L}) \\end{equation}\\] The three first-order conditions are given by: \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\lambda} &amp;=Q - TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L} = 0,\\\\ \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial K} &amp;= r - \\lambda\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_K}{\\partial K}TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L}= 0,\\\\ \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial L} &amp;= \\omega - \\lambda\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\partial L}TK^{\\alpha_K}L^{\\alpha_L}= 0.\\\\ \\end{align}\\] The first condition ensures that the production target is reached. The second condition equates the marginal costs of capital to the marginal benefits of capital. The third condition equates the marginal costs of labour to the marginal benefits of labour. In Appendix A we show that the optimal capital and labour are given by: \\[\\begin{align} K^\\ast &amp;= \\frac{Q}{T}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha_K+\\alpha_L}}\\frac{\\omega}{r}^{\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K+\\alpha_L}}\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_L}^{\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K+\\alpha_L}},\\\\ L^\\ast &amp;= \\frac{Q}{T}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha_K+\\alpha_L}}\\frac{r}{\\omega}^{\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_K+\\alpha_L}}\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K}^{\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_K+\\alpha_L}},\\\\ \\end{align}\\] It might be useful for you to program these expressions in order to see how the target quantity, the technology parameters, the input prices and the input elasticities relate to the optimally chosen inputs. First, the optimal inputs are non-linear in the target quantity and the shape depends on the sum of the input elasticities. With increasing returns in production, the optimal inputs are convex in the target quantity. With constant returns, the optimal inputs are linear in the target quantity and with decreasing returns in production, the inputs are concave in the target quantity. Second, the optimal inputs depend on the relative input prices, decrease in the own input price and increase in the input price of the other input. For the optimal choice of capital— \\(\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K+\\alpha_L}\\) is the elasticity with respect to the input price \\(r\\): when the interest rate increases with 1% the optimal capital will decrease with \\(\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K+\\alpha_L}\\)%. Furthermore, \\(\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K+\\alpha_L}&gt;0\\)is the elasticity of optimal capital with respect to labour prices. When labour prices are interpreted as wages this gives useful insights in how wage changes impact input substitution. Therefore, there is an important one-to-one relationship between the production elasticities and the elasticity of input prices. Third, when technology improves and \\(T\\) increases, the optimal inputs decrease as production per unit of input is higher. Suppose production becomes \\(z\\) times more effective due to an increase in \\(T\\) from \\(T\\) to \\(zT\\). Optimal inputs then change with a factor \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha_K+ \\alpha_L}}\\). For example, when production becomes \\(50\\)% more effective due to newly developed robot technology, and \\(\\alpha_K+\\alpha_L=1\\), this implies that the new inputs are \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{1.5}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1}} = \\frac{2}{3}\\) of the old inputs. Robot technology therefore is expected to decrease both capital and labour. Fourth, the optimal inputs relate in a complicated way to the input elasticities via the multiplication factor. For constant returns, \\(\\alpha_K+\\alpha_L = 1\\) the expressions simplify and are given by: \\[\\begin{align} K^\\ast &amp;= \\frac{Q}{T}\\frac{\\omega}{r}^{\\alpha_L}\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_L}^{\\alpha_L},\\\\ L^\\ast &amp;= \\frac{Q}{T}\\frac{r}{\\omega}^{\\alpha_K}\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K}^{\\alpha_K},\\\\ \\end{align}\\] Substituting the optimal inputs in the cost function gives the optimal costs for the firm as a function of the technology parameter, the production elasticities and the input prices: \\[\\begin{equation} C(K^\\ast, L^\\ast) = rK^\\ast + \\omega L^\\ast = \\left(\\frac{Q}{T}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}} \\omega^{\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}} r^{\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_L}\\right)^{\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}} + (\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K}\\right)^{\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}} \\right). \\end{equation}\\] Before moving on it is useful to draw some conclusions from this mathematical expression of the cost function. First, the expression depends on the target quantity in potential non-linear ways. The shape of the costs function with respect to the target quantity is governed by \\(\\frac{1}{\\alpha_K+ \\alpha_L}\\) and therefore depends on the sum of the input elasticities. For increasing returns in production, the sum of the input elasticities is larger than 1 and the costs are concave in the target quantity. The costs are convex in the target quantity for decreasing returns in production. The special case of constant returns in production, \\(\\alpha_K+ \\alpha_L = 1\\), gives a linear cost function in the target quantity. The sum of the input elasticities of the production function therefore determine the shape of the cost function with respect to the quantity level. Second, the derived cost function shows an inverse relation with the technology parameter \\(T\\). The higher the level of production technology, the lower the (marginal) costs of production. The downward impact of technology improvements on costs is stronger when the sum of the parameters \\(\\alpha_K+ \\alpha_L\\). The elasticity for this parameter is given by \\(\\frac{-1}{\\alpha_K+ \\alpha_L}\\), showing that for a \\(1\\)% increase in the technology parameter, the costs decrease with \\(\\frac{1}{\\alpha_K+ \\alpha_L}\\). Third, the cost function depends in a non-linear way on the input prices \\(r\\) and \\(\\omega\\). When wages are higher, costs of the firm will increase where the strength of the increase depends on the relative size of the technology parameters \\(\\alpha_K\\) and \\(\\alpha_L\\). For example, the elasticity of costs with respect to wages is given by \\(\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}\\): for a 1% increase in the wages, costs of the firm increase with \\(\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}\\)%. For capital, a \\(1\\)% increase in the capital price leads to a \\(\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}\\)% increase in the costs of the firm. Fourth, the technology parameters \\(\\alpha_K\\) and \\(\\alpha_L\\) enter the cost function in a complicated non-linear way in the last term of the cost function. When researchers log-linearize the cost function this part ends up in the regression constant. Fifth, from the cost function we can derive the average costs and the marginal costs: \\[\\begin{align} AC &amp;= \\frac{C(K^\\ast, L^\\ast)}{Q} =\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}}Q^{\\frac{1- \\alpha_K - \\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}} \\omega^{\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}} r^{\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_L}\\right)^{\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}} + (\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K}\\right)^{\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}} \\right), \\\\ MC &amp;= \\frac{\\partial C(K^\\ast, L^\\ast)}{\\partial Q} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}}Q^{\\frac{1- \\alpha_K - \\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}} \\omega^{\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}} r^{\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_L}\\right)^{\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}} + (\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K}\\right)^{\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}} \\right) \\end{align}\\] Marginal and average costs are independent of the target quantity when there are constant returns to scale. For increasing returns, the average costs decrease in the target quantity and for decreasing returns average costs increase. For constant returns to scale the average and marginal costs curves are equal. This shows again the important role of the input elasticities. At the end of this sub-section it is useful to discuss the producer results of pillar (1.) in relation to the third pillar of economic analysis: empiricism. There are two ways to investigate the structural parameters of the cost function. First, empirical economists have employed regression estimates of the Cobb-Douglas production function using realized quantities of firms as a function of the firms’ inputs. This can be operationalized by log-linearizing the production function: \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln Q = \\ln T + \\alpha_K \\ln K + \\alpha_L \\ln L + \\epsilon \\end{equation}\\] Such a regression requires firm data on production quantities and levels of inputs. Statistical tests can be performed in order see whether the cost function is significantly different from linear (in quantity \\(Q\\)). These tests use \\(\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L=1\\) as the null hypothesis. The second strategy is to run regressions directly on the cost functions. For example, Pillai (2015)) estimates the average production cost function for the market for solar panels using average cost levels and data on input prices, realized quantities and input levels. Log-linearizing the average cost function gives the following equation: \\[\\begin{align} \\ln AC =&amp; -\\frac{1}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L} + \\frac{1 - \\alpha_K - \\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L} \\ln Q + \\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L }\\ln \\omega + \\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L} \\ln r + \\\\ &amp;\\left( \\left( \\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_L} \\right)^{\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L}} + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_L}{\\alpha_K} \\right)^\\frac{\\alpha_K}{\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L} \\right) \\end{align}\\] The first and the last term of this equation can be combined in a regression constant. The regression equation that is estimated is then given by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln AC = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\ln Q + \\beta_2 \\ln \\omega + \\beta_3 \\ln r + \\epsilon. \\end{equation}\\] Hypothesis testing can be performed to see whether parameters are in accordance with the Cobb-Douglas specification. For example, theory dictates that for Cobb-Douglas to hold we must have \\(\\beta_2 + \\beta_3 = 1\\) and \\(\\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_3 = 0\\). If these test fail, then the Cobb-Douglas production function is not a good approximation. Increasing returns imply that \\(\\beta_1&lt;0\\), decreasing returns imply \\(\\beta_1 &gt;0\\) and constant returns in production imply \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\). When Cobb-Douglas is appropriate, we can retrieve the structural parameters of the production function from the regression estimates: \\[\\begin{align} \\alpha_K +\\alpha_L &amp;= \\frac{1 - \\beta_1}{\\beta_1},\\\\ \\alpha_L &amp;= \\beta_2 \\frac{1 - \\beta_1}{\\beta_1},\\\\ \\alpha_K &amp;= \\beta_3 \\frac{1 - \\beta_1}{\\beta_1},\\\\ T &amp;= \\frac{1 - \\beta_1}{\\beta_1}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\beta_3}{\\beta_2} \\right)^{\\beta_2} +\\left(\\frac{\\beta_2}{\\beta_3} \\right)^{\\beta_3} - \\beta_0\\right] \\end{align}\\] 2.3.4 Special case: constant average and marginal costs The general cost function that is derived above allows us to derive simpler cases by making additional assumptions. When regression shows that it is plausible to assume that there are constant returns to scale in production, \\(\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L =1\\), and the cost function simplifies and can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} C(K^\\ast, L^\\ast) = \\frac{1}{T}Qr^{\\alpha_K}\\omega^{1-\\alpha_K}. \\end{equation}\\] Average costs are then given by \\(\\frac{C(K^\\ast,L^\\ast)}{Q}\\) and are constant given the assumptions made in this subsection. Marginal costs are given by the first derivative of the optimal costs with respect to the target quantity and are equal to the average costs: \\[\\begin{equation} MC = AC = \\frac{\\partial C(K^\\ast,L^\\ast)}{\\partial Q} = \\frac{C(K^\\ast,L^\\ast)}{Q} = \\frac{1}{T}r^{\\alpha_K}\\omega^{1-\\alpha_K}. \\end{equation}\\] This simple expression accounts for the substitution of inputs of a firm and allows us to analyse exogenous changes in marginal costs due to changes in technology (via \\(T\\)), strength of substitution between inputs (via \\(\\alpha_K\\)) and changing input prices (via \\(r\\) and \\(\\omega\\)). Because—given the assumptions—optimal costs are linear in the target quantity, marginal costs for the firm are constant per unit of production. However, this does not imply that marginal costs cannot be different for different firms as the input elasticities and the technology parameter might be different for different firms. 2.3.5 Empirical examples This section discusses two examples. First, we discuss one of the key sustainability innovations in the energy market: the production of solar panels. A second example is given for the production function of housing. Both examples are related to the key sustainability issues of climate change and spatial planning. When there are exogenous improvements in production technology over time it is expected that the technology parameter \\(T\\) will increase over time. Indeed, such a result has been found in the literature on solar panels. Pillai (2015) finds an average 21% annual reduction in average production costs over the time period 2005–2012.9 For solar panels, it is expected that capital, materials and labour are the main inputs. According to Pillai (2015) (p.289), capital and materials are the main inputs and firms substitute these inputs in order to optimize production. The input prices for materials and capital therefore make an important contribution on the average and marginal costs of solar panels (see Pillai (2015), Table 4). For example, the decreasing input price for polysilicon material inputs contributes to 7% of the cost efficiency improvement over the time period 2005–2012. This result shows that input prices can be key drivers for average cost reductions of sustainable energy solutions and that the discussion on producer behaviour is related to recent research on sustainability innovations. The second example that we discuss is related to sustainable spatial planning and more specifically to the production function of housing which is studied by Epple, Gordon, and Sieg (2010). They estimated the production function for new housing for the greater metropolitan area of Pittsburgh. Their Cobb-Douglas function includes land inputs \\(R\\) and non-land inputs \\(M\\) such as building materials and capital (note that in their paper they use \\(L\\) for land inputs, but we already used \\(L\\) for labour, so use \\(R\\) instead). Firms can for example choose to substitute land and materials by building houses with multiple floors. $epple2010new estimate the following production function:10 \\[\\begin{equation} f(R,M) = 1.38 R^{0.144} M^{0.856}. \\end{equation}\\] The elasticity of production with respect to land is therefore given by \\(0.144\\) which means that for a 1% increase in the amount of land inputs, housing production increases with \\(0.144\\)%. Because the elasticities add up to 1, there are constant returns to scale. The marginal cost function and the average cost function for the metropolitan Pittsburgh area are constant and can be derived as a function of the input prices for land (\\(p_R\\)) and non-land inputs (\\(p_M\\)): \\[\\begin{equation} MC = AC = \\frac{\\partial C(K^\\ast,L^\\ast)}{\\partial Q} = \\frac{C(K^\\ast,L^\\ast)}{Q} = \\frac{1}{1.38}p_R^{0.144}p_M^{1- 0.144}. \\end{equation}\\] Usually the price of land is different for different locations resulting in marginal costs of building houses which are potentially different over space. Another recent study by Combes, Duranton, and Gobillon (2021) estimate the production function for newly built single-family homes for France: “or newly built single-family homes in France, the production function for housing is close to constant returns and is well, though not perfectly, approximated by a Cobb-Douglas function with a capital elasticity of 0.65.” (Combes et al. 2021, abstract) They show that the Cobb-Douglas production function gives a reasonable (but not perfect) approximation and that the capital elasticity is estimated at 0.65. The elasticity estimate for land is around 0.35, as the paper shows constant returns is a reasonable approximation. This elasticity estimate for land is higher than the value found for Pittsburgh. These two examples show how closely linked recent empirical results are to the theory of production functions and cost functions. The theory of production functions can also be linked to recent developments on circular economy. In the context of housing production there can be shortage of building materials. It is expected that this will impact the input prices for building materials and thereby leads to input substitution and higher marginal production costs of housing. When the housing market works in a more circular way, materials of old houses will be re-used and re-offered on the market. This implies that the total supply of housing production inputs will be higher when competitive circular material use is possible. 2.3.6 From firm costs to market inverse supply and supply The next step is to relate the firm marginal costs to the market inverse supply curve. Again, the aggregation of marginal costs curves into an inverse supply curve is not trivial, but the intuition is similar as with consumer analysis. Aggregation can be done by sorting heterogeneous firms according to their marginal costs per unit of the market good. This gives the market inverse supply curve \\(s(Q)\\) for the market good which express what the price should be for which an amount \\(Q\\) of the market good is supplied. Marginal costs for the firm can be constant per unit of production, but this does not imply that there is no heterogeneity in marginal costs for different firms. For example, the firms might have similar input prices, but different input elasticities and technology parameters. The inverse of the inverse supply curve is the supply curve \\(Q^S(p)\\), which shows how much is supplied at the market for a given level of the market price \\(p\\). Empirical economists regularly estimate the price elasticity of supply which is defined as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\kappa = \\frac{\\partial Q^S}{\\partial p}\\frac{p}{Q^{S(p)}}. \\end{equation}\\] For a 1% increase in the market price, the market supply will change with \\(\\kappa\\)%. When the slope of the supply function \\(\\frac{\\partial Q^S}{\\partial p}\\) is very large, the supply function is steeply increasing in the price and supply is elastic. Supply then responds strongly to price changes. An empirical example of supply elasticities can be given using the work of Green, Malpezzi, and Mayo (2005) on housing supply in the US. The table in Figure 2.3 is from their paper and shows price elasticities of supply in the range of \\(-0.30\\) (Miami) up to \\(29.9\\) (Dallas). These estimates are therefore widely varying over space. Not all estimates are significant (confidence intervals are not reported). For Pittsburgh, the elasticity is estimated at 1.43 and significant at the 1% level. This implies that a 1% increase in the price of housing will lead to 1.43% increase in the housing supply in Pittsburgh. For Atlanta, housing supply is more elastic: a 1% increase in the price of housing leads to an estimated 21.6% increase in housing supply. Later we will see how elasticities are related to policies related to prices. Figure 2.3: Price elasticities of housing supply 2.3.7 Producer surplus For the analysis of producer surplus, it is assumed that all firms ask the same price for their product.11 Total revenues in the market are then given by \\(p^\\ast Q^\\ast\\). Given these assumptions, there will be firms in the market who make a profit. Low-marginal cost firms do not compete other firms out of the market by offering lower prices and firms do not propose customer specific prices. In the absence of fixed costs, total costs in the market are given by the area under the supply curve. Producer surplus can be mathematically described as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} PS = p^\\ast Q^\\ast - \\int_0^{Q^\\ast} s(Q)dQ. \\end{equation}\\] Using information on the marginal cost curve we can derive producer surplus using integral calculus. Suppose the inverse supply curve is independent of the market quantity and given by: \\[\\begin{equation} s(Q) = \\frac{B}{T}r^{\\alpha_K}\\omega^{1-\\alpha_L}. \\end{equation}\\] Here, \\(B\\) is a proportional constant that captures the aggregation of firms. Substituting in the expression for producer surplus then results in: \\[\\begin{align} PS &amp;= p^\\ast Q^\\ast - \\int_0^{Q^\\ast} \\frac{B}{T}r^{\\alpha_K}\\omega^{1-\\alpha_L} dQ = p^\\ast Q\\ast \\left[Q \\frac{B}{T}r^{\\alpha_K}\\omega^{1-\\alpha_L} + z\\right]^{Q^\\ast}_0 \\\\ &amp;= p^\\ast Q^\\ast - Q^\\ast \\frac{B}{T}r^{\\alpha_K}\\omega^{1-\\alpha_L}. \\end{align}\\] This requires input on the equilibrium price and quantity, the technology parameter, the input prices and the production elasticity of substitution. 2.4 Analysis of economic surplus 2.4.1 Introduction Now that we have completed the analysis of the choice behaviour of consumers and consumer value in markets (section 2), and the choice behaviour of producers and producer value in markets (section 3), we continue our analysis on the second pillar of economics: the analysis of equilibrium. The assumption of equilibrium ensures that the interaction of consumers and producers in the market is properly accounted for and gives new information for the researcher. Not all consumers will buy the market good and not all potential firms will participate in selling goods on the market. Some might be interested but will not receive sufficient gains from trade. 2.4.2 Equilibrium Demand and supply interact which may lead to equilibrium in markets. The equilibrium intuition is governed by the following two equalities: \\[\\begin{equation} p(Q^\\ast)= p^\\ast=s(Q^\\ast). \\end{equation}\\] The first equality \\(p(Q^\\ast)= p^\\ast\\) states that the marginal benefits of the equilibrium consumer at \\(Q^\\ast\\) are equal to the equilibrium price. Customers at the left of \\(Q^\\ast\\) will buy the good because their marginal WTP is higher than the equilibrium price. Customers at the right side of \\(Q^\\ast\\) will not participate in the market, because their marginal WTP is lower than the equilibrium price. The second equality \\(p^\\ast=s(Q^\\ast)\\) states that the equilibrium price should be equal to the marginal costs of production for the equilibrium quantity produced. Firms at the left of \\(Q^\\ast\\) have lower marginal costs than the equilibrium price and will therefore continue to sell their goods. Firms at the right of \\(Q^\\ast\\) have higher marginal costs than the equilibrium price and will therefore choose not to produce the good. 2.4.3 Calibration of equilibrium How to fit the conceptual model to a real market in order to do justice to the third pillar: empiricism? That is the challenge of calibration in this section. Using the equilibrium equations, it is possible to recover two unknown parameters of the demand and supply function. If one also has information about the equilibrium elasticities, it is possible to calibrate four model parameters. This is the reason that the estimation of equilibrium elasticities is an important task of empirical economists. In the previous section we have seen estimates for these elasticities for different kinds of market goods. The tables below can be used for calibration of the (inverse) market demand and supply curves given this knowledge on the estimated (equilibrium) elasticities. Table 2.1: Demand and supply elasticities and model parameters Case description Inverse demand Implied demand curve and equilibrium price elasticity of demand Inverse supply Implied supply curve and equilibrium price elasticity of supply Case I: Exponential inverse demand and exponential inverse supply \\(p(Q)=Ae^{-\\alpha Q}\\) Parameter assumptions: \\(A&gt;0\\), \\(\\alpha&gt;0\\).

Equilibrium elasticities can be obtained from the literature or from an empirical analysis of demand and supply data. Equilibrium prices and quantities can be observed for the market that you are interested in. [INSERT TABLE HERE] The parameters \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can be calibrated using the identities for the inverse demand and inverse supply at the equilibrium. The parameters a and b can be calibrated using the equations we have for the price elasticities for specified demand and supply functions (see Table 2.1). To illustrate how a market can be calibrated using elasticities from the literature we provide an example of case I: exponential inverse demand and inverse supply functions. Table 3 shows information we have about the equilibrium elasticities for vegan nuggets. [INSERT TABLE HERE] Using the first row of Table 1 we then calibrate the parameters of the inverse demand and the inverse supply function. These are given in Table 4: [INSERT TABLE HERE] Using the calibrated inverse demand and inverse supply function one can derive the consumer benefits, the producer costs and economic surplus as we will see in the next section. The important insight here is that model parameters can be calibrated using empirical observations of equilibrium prices and quantity and empirical estimates of the equilibrium elasticities. This provides the bridge between theoretical and conceptual models and empirical observations. 2.4.4 Analysis of economic surplus Economic surplus (ES) generated in the market is given by the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It seeks to combine pillar (3.) with a particular view on normativity (pillar 4.): for the calculation of economic surplus it is assumed that: The choices of market actors express their value attached to the market products; Choice value can be fully counted as economic surplus because the choices of market actors are ‘good’. We come back to these assumptions in weeks 2 and 3. Mathematically, economic surplus is defined by: \\[\\begin{align} ES = CS + PS &amp;= \\underbrace{\\int_0^{Q^\\ast} p(Q)dQ - p^\\ast Q^\\ast}_\\text{Consumer surplus} + \\underbrace{p^\\ast Q^\\ast - \\int^{Q^\\ast}_0 s(Q)dQ}_\\text{Producer surplus}\\\\ &amp;= \\underbrace{\\int_0^{Q^\\ast} p(Q)dQ}_\\text{Total consumer benefits} - \\underbrace{\\int^{Q^\\ast}_0 s(Q)dQ}_\\text{Total consumer costs}. \\end{align}\\] The first line shows the first way to express economic surplus: it is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. Consumer surplus is the area under the inverse demand curve minus the consumer spending on the market good. Producer surplus is the producer revenues minus the total producer costs. Producer costs are equal to the area under the inverse supply curve (because it is assumed that fixed costs are 0). The advantage of this way of expressing economic surplus is that it is clear how the surplus is divided between consumers and producers. Sometimes national governments are only interested in the consumer surplus for a particular product for inhabitants of their own country and not in the producer surplus of firms in other countries. Therefore, it might be useful to report both \\(CS\\) and \\(PS\\) and to state where the benefits fall. There is a second way to express economic surplus, which is given by the second line of the equation. Because payments of consumers are revenues for producers, the second and the third term cancel out resulting in an equation which states that consumer surplus is equal to the consumer benefits minus the producer costs. Interestingly, one does not have to observe the equilibrium prices in order to calculate economic surplus as long as one knows the inverse demand and inverse supply curves and the equilibrium quantity. At this point it is also useful to investigate the point for which economic surplus is optimal. Differentiating economic surplus with respect to the equilibrium quantity gives: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial ES}{\\partial Q^\\ast} = p(Q^\\ast) - s(Q^\\ast) = 0 \\end{equation}\\] This is equal to the equilibrium condition which states that marginal benefits are equal to marginal costs. The expression shows that economic surplus in the market is optimal when marginal consumer benefits are equal to marginal costs in equilibrium. In the absence of other costs and considerations, one can conclude with Adam Smith from this equation that free trade will result in the maximum economic surplus. However, one should keep in mind that together with the assumptions on rationality, equilibrium is imposed rather than empirically supported using data analysis and that particular pillar (4.) assumptions on normativity are made that might not hold in practice. Integral calculus can be employed to derive economic surplus for particular specifications of the inverse demand and the inverse supply curve. We will illustrate this for an example. Suppose the inverse supply curve is exponentially increasing in quantity and given by: \\[\\begin{equation} s(Q) = B e^{bQ}, \\quad B&gt;0, \\quad b &gt;0. \\end{equation}\\] Furthermore, assume that the inverse demand curve is exponential and given by: \\[\\begin{equation} p(Q) = Ae^{-\\alpha Q}, \\quad A&gt;0, \\quad \\alpha &gt;0. \\end{equation}\\] Substitution in the expression for economic surplus gives: \\[\\begin{align} ES &amp;= \\underbrace{\\int_0^{Q^\\ast} Ae^{-\\alpha Q} dQ}_\\text{Total consumer benefits} - \\underbrace{\\int^{Q^\\ast}_0 B e^{bQ}dQ}_\\text{Total consumer costs}\\\\ &amp;= \\left[-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}Ae^{-\\alpha Q} + z\\right]^{Q^\\ast}_0 - \\left[\\frac{1}{b}B e^{bQ} + w\\right]^{Q^\\ast}_0 \\\\ &amp;= -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}A\\left(e^{-\\alpha Q^\\ast} - 1 \\right) -\\frac{1}{b}B\\left(e^{b Q^\\ast} - 1 \\right),\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{\\alpha}A\\left(1 - e^{-\\alpha Q^\\ast} \\right) -\\frac{1}{b}B\\left(e^{b Q^\\ast} - 1 \\right). \\end{align}\\] This shows that economic surplus in the market can be written as a function of the observed equilibrium quantity and the structural parameters of the inverse demand and the inverse supply function. In the previous sub-section, we calibrated these structural parameters using information on equilibrium prices and equilibrium demand and the equilibrium demand and supply elasticities (see Table 4). We can now use these parameters to derive the consumer benefits, the producer costs and the total economic surplus in the market for vegan nuggets. Table 5 provides an extension of Table 4 and shows the results. We leave it to the reader to develop examples for the other cases 2–4. [INSERT TABLE HERE] 2.5 External costs and economic surplus 2.5.1 Introduction In the previous section we investigated mathematically the economic surplus that markets generate. This economic surplus is generated assuming free trade possibilities and equilibrium and is only related to the decisions of consumers and producers. It therefore does not account for potential other costs and benefits that fall outside the market and does not include other considerations related to rationality and normativity. More specifically, and related to sustainability, a challenge for the model developed in the previous section can be environmental costs that fall outside of the market. Examples of negative external costs of meat production/consumption for the environment are CO2 pollution, animal welfare, soil erosion, water pollution and air pollution (see Godfray et al. (2018)). External costs provide euro values of these negative impacts in order to make the impacts comparable with the market surplus of consumers and producers. Economists have argued that these costs should be added to economic surplus in order to give an honest account of the surplus that markets generate. This addition of external costs entails a particular pillar (4.) assumption on responsibility which will be discussed in the third week. In order to account for external costs (\\(EC\\)), we add the term \\(e(Q^\\ast)\\) to the economic surplus. Economic surplus is defined as: \\[\\begin{align} ES &amp;= CS + PS - EC \\\\ &amp;= \\underbrace{\\int_0^{Q^\\ast} p(Q)dQ}_\\text{Total consumer benefits} - \\underbrace{\\underbrace{\\int^{Q^\\ast}_0 s(Q)dQ}_\\text{Total consumer costs} - \\underbrace{e(Q^\\ast)}_\\text{Total external costs}}_\\text{Total social costs}. \\end{align}\\] Besides this, we also define the marginal external costs \\(MEC(Q)=\\frac{\\partial e(Q)}{\\partial Q}\\), which show, —loosely speaking—, with how much total external costs change for a change in the quantity. The total social costs are then defined as the producer costs and the external costs. The marginal social costs are given by the first derivative of the total social costs. This first derivative is equal to \\(s(Q)+MEC(Q)\\) which signifies that marginal external costs are economically speaking just another cost component above the producer costs. Again, we can investigate optimality of the extended economic surplus function by investigating the first derivative: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial ES}{\\partial Q^\\ast} = p(Q^\\ast) - s(Q^\\ast - MEC(Q^\\ast) = 0. \\end{equation}\\] This condition is different from the condition in the previous section because of the added external costs. The condition shows that—given the model assumptions—optimal economic surplus cannot be reached without intervention in the market because the behaviour of consumers and producers leads to \\(p(Q^\\ast)-s(Q^\\ast)=0\\). When marginal external costs are positive, the derivative is negative, showing that improvements in economic surplus can be obtained when demand decreases. In short, this means that when positive (marginal) external costs are ignored by market actors the prices for the market goods are too low. When there are marginal external benefits, \\(MEC(Q^\\ast )&lt;0\\), and market prices are too high. 2.5.2 General analysis of the consumer externality tax One way to deal with environmental externalities is to set a consumer tax. Mathematical analysis can be employed to investigate this consumer tax. The regulator sets a tax \\(\\tau\\) and this will result in a new equilibrium price \\(p^{\\ast R)\\) and a new equilibrium demand $Q^{R). The tax will impact the equilibrium equation for consumers as now their marginal benefits should be higher or equal to the equilibrium price plus the tax. For the equilibrium consumer we have: 2.6 Conclusion This chapter shows what the behavioural underpinnings of supply and demand in markets are and how supply and demand functions can be calibrated using elasticity estimates and observations of market prices and quantities. We have also showed how economic surplus in markets can be estimated based on the inverse demand and inverse supply functions. Furthermore, an application to consumer externality taxation is given. The models that were developed are stylised and can be used as a natural starting point for further analytical and empirical development. Remember, concave function have decreasing marginal returns such as in Figure 1.1↩︎ Recall that an inverse demand curve is a function of \\(Q\\) that determines \\(p\\)↩︎ Recall that for an optimal utility, which is what we aim for, the condition \\(\\frac{dU}{dQ} = 0\\) should hold, so from (2.4) we then know that \\(Ae^{\\alpha Q} = pB\\) leading to (2.5)↩︎ An interesting question that gives a hint for solving this issue is: could you propose a direct utility function that deals with ∈ as a parameter of the direct utility function?↩︎ It is also possible to specify this utility function as: \\(U(Q,G)=Z Q^A G^B\\). Log-linearizing gives the utility function used in the text and has no impact on the first-order condition. The constant \\(Z\\) is irrelevant for the analysis of demand.↩︎ This solution is unique. You can check this by proving that the total second-order derivative is negative.↩︎ Note that the \\(\\epsilon\\) here is different from that what we normally use in regression equations.↩︎ We therefore say that the production function is homogenous of degree \\(\\alpha_K + \\alpha_L\\).↩︎ They also show that average costs are decreasing in quantity levels.↩︎ It is not entirely clear from their paper what the dimension of the production function is and what the constant 1.38 means.↩︎ Here it becomes a bit tricky when we have heterogeneous firms as there is no real price competition going on despite the fact that low marginal costs firms can offer lower prices than high marginal cost firms. We deliberately ignore profit maximizing behaviour, imperfect substitutability between products among other issues. In theory, free entry and competition would lead to marginal costs equal to the marginal costs of the firm with the lowest costs and profits equal to 0. Despite all these issues, the model might serve as a reasonable approximation for medium term analysis of economic surplus.↩︎ "],["behavioural-error-and-economic-surplus.html", "3 Behavioural Error and Economic Surplus 3.1 Introduction", " 3 Behavioural Error and Economic Surplus 3.1 Introduction These lecture notes investigate the implications of behavioural errors for the calculation of economic surplus. The sub-field of behavioural economics started around 1950 with the pioneering works of Herbert Simon and Ward Edwards. The aim was to develop a novel perspective on rationality and choice behaviour. Laibson and List (2015) define behavioural economics as follows: Behavioural economics uses variants of traditional economic assumptions (often with a psychological motivation) to explain and predict behaviour, and to provide policy prescriptions (p.385). From their perspective, modern behavioural economics therefore can be viewed as an extension of the neo-classical perspective. Laibson and List (2015) suggest that behavioural economics refines three of the key core principles of classical economics (p.386). We add to this list how the fourth pillar ‘normativity’ changes when behavioural errors are present. Optimization: market actors try to choose their best (feasible) option. They employ heuristics or a decision goal function for choosing amounts (utility, costs etc.). Equilibrium: market actors try to choose their best feasible option when interacting with others. This results in a behavioural equilibrium. Empiricism: behavioural models need to be tested with data. Experienced based normativity: experiences (not choices) of market actors generate value and experienced value of market actors is equal to value for society. Compared to the neo-classical paradigm, behavioural economics changes the first core pillar ‘optimization’ by adding the word ‘try’. In classical economic models it is usually assumed that market actors behave rationally: choices of market actors are the result of a rational optimization procedure in the sense that choices track utility value. Behavioural economics has operationalized this idea by replacing the direct utility function by other heuristics or by other kinds of direct utility functions. An example of a consumer heuristic is: buy \\(Q\\) of the market good when it rains and \\(Q+2\\) of the market good when it does not rain. Such a heuristic is independent of the valuation or utility considerations and is therefore difficult to connect to analysis of economic surplus without further assumptions. Examples of different conceptualization of utility functions are utility functions that account for biased processing of probabilities and loss aversion (Tversky and Kahneman 1992). The second pillar states that equilibrium in markets might be affected by behavioural errors as market actors interact with each other and is a logical result of adding behavioural error at the first pillar. According to behavioural economists, consumers and producers seek to optimize, but make behavioural errors. This in turn has impacts on how market actors interact with each other. When consumers and producers make systematic mistakes, this can impact equilibrium prices and quantities, but more in-depth analysis is needed to show what the impacts of behavourial errors is on equilibrium outcomes. The third pillar states that particular assumptions on the rationality of choices made by neo-classical economists should be backed up by empirical analysis. It has been argued by neo-classical economists that choices are made as if market actors are rational. Milton Friedman (1953) wrote about this in his famous essay ‘The methodology of Positive Economics’: Consider the problem of predicting the shots made by an expert billiard player. It seems not at all unreasonable that excellent predictions would be yielded by the hypothesis that the billiard player made his shots as if he knew the complicated mathematical formulas that would give the optimum directions of travel, could estimate accurately by eye the angles, etc., describing the location of the balls, could make lightning calculations from the formulas, and could then make the balls travel in the direction indicated by the formulas. Our confidence in this hypothesis is not based on the belief that billiard players, even expert ones, can or do go through the process described; it derives rather from the belief that, unless in some way or other they were capable of reaching essentially the same result, they would not in fact be expert billiard players. It is only a short step from these examples to the economic hypothesis that under a wide range of circumstances individual firms behave as if they were seeking rationally to maximize their expected returns (generally if misleadingly called “profits”) and had full knowledge of the data needed to succeed in this attempt; as if, that is, they knew the relevant cost and demand functions, calculated marginal cost and marginal revenue from all actions open to them, and pushed each line of action to the point at which the relevant marginal cost and marginal revenues were equal (Friedman, 1953). "],["moral.html", "4 Moral Considerations and Economic Surplus 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Dealing with moral considerations at the valuation stage", " 4 Moral Considerations and Economic Surplus 4.1 Introduction These lecture notes introduce another definition of economic surplus (‘the economic pie’) that allows for moral considerations. It specifically investigates moral considerations related to the normative validity of counting costs and benefits of consumers and producers and external costs as economic social surplus. Why is this important? In the first week we have seen that the classical perspective of economic value rests on four pillars: (i) optimisation, (ii) equilibrium, (iii) empiricism and (iv) choice-based normativity. The implication of this perspective is that choices of market actors perfectly track value for society. The second week provided an extended perspective using insights from psychology. According to this perspective there can be a difference between choice-based value and experienced based value. Given particular assumptions it can be justified that experienced value is the right metric to measure instead of choice-based value. As we have seen, this has implications for policy interventions related to information provision and externality taxation. The lecture notes of week 3 question the results of the first week from a different angle: there can be moral considerations related to the choices of market actors that lead to the question whether it is justified to include the value of consumers, producers and the external costs completely in the economic surplus calculation. Before moving on, it is useful to illustrate why moral considerations are important. Consider a pork producer who is active in the market for pork. The government has set specific rules for pork production for those who want to become active in this market. With the aim of lowering marginal costs, the pork producer ignores some of these rules related to animal welfare without providing good reasons and without changing external costs. The producer rationally trades off lower marginal costs with the probability of getting a fine when being caught. According to the economic model of value developed in week 1 this leads to an increase in producer surplus in the market of pork and thereby into an increase is economic surplus. The example suggests that there are normative limits for behaviour by consumers and producers in markets that might not be captured in behavioural choice. Or consider a philosopher of animal welfare who considers the eating of pork to be morally problematic because pigs are sentient beings ‘like us’. If the reasoning of this philosopher is correct, counting consumer benefits fully as social surplus is likely to be questionable. These two examples at least illustrate that the choice-based normativity perspective (week 1) and experienced-based normativity (week 2) might not be shared by all persons and groups in society. In these lecture notes we therefore change the 4th pillar ‘normativity’ from choice-based to morally-based evaluation. How to deal with this in cost-benefit analysis? The key question to investigate here is: “What should count as ‘better or worse off’?” (Atkinson 2009; Sandel 2013). This normative question can be investigated from different viewpoints: the individual level, the community level and the societal level. At the individual level, consumers and producers make moral commitments to their own perspective on the good life. They might want to eat less meat, fly less and might want to lower their carbon emissions by making more sustainable choices. However, these moral commitments and targets are not always reached leading to a discrepancy between the individuals’ perspective on the good life and their actual choices. Most persons are aware of this gap between their goals and actual behaviour in their personal lives. For example, sometimes individuals make promises to particular sustainability targets to others but do not keep these promises. Another example is the observation of flight shame which suggests that individuals have an independent reflective moral attitude (conscience) towards their own behaviour. Even when choices (week 1) and experiences (week 2) are valuable and decisions are made to buy the product, this suggests that these choices might not be evaluated as truly ‘good’ by the individual. At the community level, individuals participate in communities who determine (partly or fully) what counts as valuable. Community membership can be voluntary or non-voluntary and membership of communities results in particular duties and customs. Communities entail particular minimum standards of behaviour for consumers and producers based on the community values. These standards can be viewed as partly independent of the preferences that are expressed by consumers and producers in their day-to-day market choices. For example, an activist participating in a ‘climate change community’ is likely to be held accountable for behavioural choices: only ‘telling the truth’ is likely not sufficient according the community standards. At the societal level, individuals participate in the common project of living together. Governments can formulate particular minimal sustainability standards for market participants which in turn can lead to particular duties and customs for market actors. This was illustrated with the example of the pork producer above. Furthermore, governments can ask market participants to make concrete commitments in terms of sustainability. Goals can act as targets for moral excellence and result in obligations. In order to count something as valuable for society these different viewpoints can play a role and can result in a discrepancy between choice-based value and morally weighted social value. In line with the results of week 2 this can imply that the social optimum is not reached even when there are no external costs. Note that the different viewpoints do not restrict choice of market actors but seek to foster a plural perspective on what should count as valuable. The remainder of these lecture notes is structured as follows. First, Section II gives an overview of several strategies that are employed to deal with moral considerations when valuing market outcomes. This section motivates why an adjustment of economic surplus is needed when moral considerations are present. Section III develops a novel analytical specification of economic surplus and sections IV and V discuss the implications for pricing. Examples are provided along the way. Section VI concludes. 4.2 Dealing with moral considerations at the valuation stage 4.2.1 Introduction This section discusses four general approaches to deal with moral considerations when analysing (changes) in economic social surplus. The first approach is the ethical checkbox approach (section II.B), the second approach is the economizing ethics approach (section II.C), the third approach is the ethicizing economics approach (section II.D). The fourth approach is the qualitative valuation approach (section II.E). These approaches are not necessarily perfect substitutes but can be employed in a complementary way. 4.2.2 Ethical checkbox approach The first approach to deal with moral considerations is the ‘ethical checkbox’ approach (ECH). This approach analyses moral considerations independently of economic surplus assessments using a list of necessary ethical requirements or rules for the behaviour of market actors. It is closely related to the ‘independent doctrine’ which views (micro-)economics as separate from ethics (see High (1985, p,.4-6), for a "],["regression-analysis-in-the-social-sciences.html", "5 Regression analysis in the social sciences 5.1 So, what is the problem? 5.2 Statistical framework 5.3 Univariate regression 5.4 Least squares assumptions 5.5 Testing of coefficients", " 5 Regression analysis in the social sciences Why should we have something as applied econometrics in the social sciences? That is because we have theories as in Chapters (2)–(4) and those theories contain variables such as in the direct utility function of equation (2.3): \\[\\begin{equation} U(Q,G) = \\frac{A}{\\alpha}\\left( 1- e^{-\\alpha Q} \\right ) + BG. \\end{equation}\\] Here the quantities for the market good \\(Q\\) and the outside good \\(G\\) are to considered to be known—also often referred to as data. In theoretical work they are fictional or sometimes simulated. A certain amount of consumption of the market good and the outside good lead then some level of utility which an economist want to maximise. This course is about using data to measure causal effects. Ideally, we would like an experiment, but almost always we only have observational data on returns to education (aka wages), housing prices or commuting flows.
